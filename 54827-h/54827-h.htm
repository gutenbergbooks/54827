<h3>AUTHOR&rsquo;S NOTE</h3>
<p>It is natural that, within the
confines of these few pages, many facets of Leonardo&rsquo;s
extraordinary personality will be missing. That he was
an artist, a man of letters, a poet and a philosopher are
well known. That he was also a man of humor, as well
as a prophet whose vision extended far beyond his times,
are facts that I have also tried to include in this biography.
There are many gaps in our knowledge of his life,
and these I have sometimes filled with my own imagination
to give some continuity to his story. Little is known
of his early days, his period of travels after leaving
Milan and his years in Rome. There is, too, a certain
mystery in his relations to those around him, since our
descriptions of him derive mostly from his often cryptic,
personal notes and from biographers who wrote of him
many years after he had died.</p>
<p>This book is about Leonardo the scientist, and to fully
write of his many accomplishments would require an
encyclopedic mind. My intent has been to extract the
essence of his story in the hopes that it would arouse
the enthusiasm of a reader to further his interest in those
other, more fully documented books&mdash;and, above all,
in the notebooks that Leonardo himself wrote.</p>

<p>Dusk was beginning to gather in the valley at the foot
of Monte Albano as young Leonardo turned toward
home. Stopping by a rushing stream to wash the dust
of the day&rsquo;s explorations from his face, he laid aside his
cap and his leather pouch and plunged his hands into the
cold mountain water. He felt the force of the current
and watched the whirl and flow of bubbles around his
bare arms. There was the same feeling, he thought, to
the flow of air he had experienced blowing around the
<span class="pb" id="Page_2">2</span>
rocky crags of the mountains.</p>
<p>This evening, however, there was no time to sit
awhile and think. He was in a hurry to get home. Hastily
scooping the water in his cupped palms, he splashed
it over his head and face, then shaking the water from
his hair he rose and picked up his cap. He took a satisfied
look in his pouch, slung it over his shoulder and
headed down the stony trail to the village of Vinci.</p>
<p>Vinci was a small hill town situated on a spur of
Monte Albano. Its castle and the bell tower above the
houses seemed like sentinels guarding the slopes of vineyards
and olive groves spreading down into the valley.</p>
<p>Leonardo da Vinci, which means &ldquo;Leonardo from
the town of Vinci,&rdquo; thought about his home. He knew
that he had been born in Anchiano, near Vinci, on
April 15 of the year 1452, to a peasant girl named
Caterina. At the age of five, he had been sent for by his
natural father, Piero da Vinci, to come and live at his
family&rsquo;s house in Vinci, a comfortable and roomy place
with a spacious garden. Piero, five years before, had
married Albiera di Giovanni Amadori, a girl of sixteen.
They had had no children of their own, and Leonardo
was welcomed into the home with affection by his
young stepmother.</p>
<p>When Leonardo was about eleven, young Albiera
died, leaving a darkened and saddened house. Two years
later his father married another girl by the name of
Francesca Lanfredini. Although laughter and song soon
replaced the grief, Leonardo never forgot the love of
his first stepmother.</p>
<p>Also in the house lived Antonio, his grandfather, who
<span class="pb" id="Page_3">3</span>
was eighty-five, his grandmother, his uncle Allessandro
Amadori and family, and, best of all, his uncle Francesco.
The da Vincis, who could trace their beginnings
in the town back to the thirteenth century, had always
been respected lawyers and landowners. Because Uncle
Francesco was neither a lawyer nor a great landowner,
the people of the town said he did nothing; but he
tended the family vineyards, and, to the delight of
Leonardo, he raised his own silkworms.</p>
<p>As Leonardo entered the main gate, he noticed that
the oil lamps were being lit above the stalls of the marketplace,
and the lively confusion of the last hours of
business was in full swing. People nodded and smiled
to him, for as a boy of fifteen he was already a striking
figure. He was tall with long, auburn hair falling to his
shoulders and his face was so charming that it was frequently
compared to those of the angels painted in the
chapels of the church. The music of his lute, the sound
of his voice, and the gentleness of his person were such
that all hearts and doors were open to him.</p>
<p>Tonight, however, Leonardo avoided the usual invitations
to stop and chat. His father would be back from
Florence; he had been going there more and more frequently
as his fame as a lawyer grew. Now Leonardo
was thinking that he had almost finished the assignment
his father, half jokingly, had given him many weeks
ago&mdash;so many weeks ago that he was sure his father
had forgotten about it. At that time a peasant, whose
skill in providing fish and game for the table of Piero&rsquo;s
big household was greatly appreciated, had asked a
favor of him. This man had a round, wooden shield cut
from a fig tree and he had asked Piero to have a design
painted on it for him in Florence. Piero, who had
noticed the sketches his son was making of plants, rock
formations, and scenes in his wanderings about the
countryside, decided to test his son&rsquo;s ability and gave
the shield to the boy. In the secrecy of his room, into
which no one was allowed, Leonardo had smoothed
and prepared the wood, and on it he was painting a
<span class="pb" id="Page_4">4</span>
monster.</p>
<p>Scrambling over rocks, through streams, and into
caves, Leonardo had been in the habit of gathering all
manner of creeping and crawling life. Patiently he
would bring these home in his leather pouch and carefully
study and draw them. Maggots, bats, butterflies,
locusts, and snakes added to the confusion of the boy&rsquo;s
already cluttered room. Everywhere he went he collected
the things that aroused his curiosity; and as a
result, his room was always filled with rocks, dried
plants, flowers, the skeletons of small animals&mdash;and his
pages of notations and drawings. Now Leonardo had
combined the features of these small forms of life to
make a monster&mdash;emerging from a dark grotto and
breathing fire and smoke&mdash;a thing more terrifying than
if done from imagination, for each feature was a duplicate
of a reality in nature.</p>
<p>Unobserved, Leonardo reached the privacy of his
<span class="pb" id="Page_5">5</span>
room and emptied this day&rsquo;s collection on a table beside
the shield. He lit a candle and examined his catch&mdash;a
lizard and a large grasshopper. These would complete
his picture; and, the most extraordinary find of the day&mdash;a
fossil seashell found high on the slopes of a mountain!
How did it get there? Was it a result of the flood
about which his religion had taught him? Had an immense
wave deposited this ancient sea-life high on the
Albano mountains? Looking more closely he saw that
it was a type of sea-snail and in almost perfect preservation.
This he would have to think about and examine
later.</p>
<p>Now, however, the picture must be completed, for
he hoped to surprise his father in the morning. But just
then, Leonardo heard the family stirring below and
his father calling him to dinner. Reluctantly he left his
table, made himself presentable and went downstairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, Leonardo,&rdquo; his father said when he appeared in
the family dining room. &ldquo;I saw Benedetto dell&rsquo;Abbaco
on the way in town and he tells me you haven&rsquo;t been
to school as often as you should&mdash;is that true?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Papa&mdash;but I&rsquo;m not doing badly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Signor Benedetto might agree, at least in your
mathematics. He tells me you ask him questions that
often make him stop and think. But Leonardo, you
have other subjects&mdash;Latin, reading, and writing&mdash;as
well as arithmetic. You mustn&rsquo;t neglect the others, my
boy. But come&mdash;let us eat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Together they sat down with the rest of the family&mdash;a
large, prosperous, and happy gathering. When dinner
was over Leonardo made hurried excuses to all the
family, protesting that he was too tired to sing, and
escaped back into his room. For a long time he worked,
unaware that the house was growing quieter. Finally
he laid down his brushes and his maul stick, pushed his
chair back and smiled a triumphant smile. The shield
was finished. Tomorrow he would ask his father in to
look at it.</p>
<p>Conscious now that everybody had gone to bed,
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
Leonardo blew out his candle and opened the shutters.
The night sky was a panoply of stars and only here and
there was the dark loneliness of the valley relieved by
pinpoints of light. Leonardo leaned his head against the
window frame and stared at the blue infinity above him.
What exactly were the stars? Did all of them move
around the earth? What was the haze that obscured the
horizon ever so faintly? What was that sea-snail doing
in the mountains? Why? How?</p>
<p>The next morning Leonardo found his father and
Uncle Francesco in the garden deep in conversation
about their vineyards and olive groves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Papa, I have a surprise for you up in my room&mdash;can
you come now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Leonardo. What is it you have found now&mdash;not
a better way to raise my grapes, I&rsquo;ll wager!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The elder da Vinci put his arm around the boy&rsquo;s
shoulder and went with him up to the door of his room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait here, Papa, until I say to come in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leonardo unlocked his door, lifted the cloth from
the shield standing on the easel and opened the shutter
just a trifle so that a soft light filled the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Papa&mdash;you can come in now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Piero entered&mdash;he had long forgotten the round piece
of wood&mdash;and suddenly he froze in the middle of the
room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have mercy on me!&rdquo; he said when he saw the horrible
fire-breathing creature. In the dimness of the room,
the monster and the murky cave from which it was
emerging were terribly real. Piero actually started to
back out of the room in fright, when Leonardo laid a
hand on his shoulder.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">7</div>
<p>&ldquo;Papa, this work has served its purpose; take it away,
then, for it has produced the intended effect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The shield was the talk of the house; it was set up
and marveled at. As for Piero, he resolved to take it
with him to Florence secretly and sell it, giving his peasant
friend some cheap substitute that he would buy in
the marketplace.</p>
<p>So, a few days later, Leonardo&rsquo;s father saddled his
horse and had the shield wrapped and packed in his
saddlebag. Also, unknown to his son, he took some of
the boy&rsquo;s drawings. Piero had now realized that Leonardo
might have a rare talent. Moreover, he was planning
to move to Florence with his family so that he
could be nearer to the Badia, or the law offices of the
city, for whom he had been frequently employed.
There, thought Piero, Leonardo&rsquo;s talent could be developed
under the best of teachers.</p>
<p>It was many days before Leonardo&rsquo;s father returned;
when he did, he gathered his family together and it was
obvious to all that he had exciting news. First, Piero
announced that he and Francesca would move to Florence
since he and a law partner were now engaged in
securing office space from the Badia. It was a handsome
office centrally located opposite the palace of the <i>Podest&agrave;</i>,
or chief magistrate.</p>
<p>Then, turning to Leonardo, he said: &ldquo;I have shown
some of your drawings to Master Andrea del Verrochio
and his enthusiasm for your skill has decided me to
place you in his studio as an apprentice. What do you
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
think of that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leonardo was stunned. Verrochio, the great artist
and sculptor! Florence! The city-state whose power
and influence had spread far beyond her own walls.
Now he would study in earnest; now he would find the
answers to his never-ending questions. He embraced his
father and could say nothing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>

<br /><i>Florence</i></h2>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="49" />
</div>
<p>The Italy of Medieval and Renaissance days was not a
unified country as it is today. It was, of course, part of
the Holy Roman Empire, but the main governing forces
in the land were in the city-states, of which Florence
was one of the most powerful. A city-state was much
more than a city&mdash;it was almost a kingdom in itself.
Each had its own army, and very often there were large-scale
wars between such city-states as Milan, Naples,
Rome, Venice&mdash;and of course Florence. The Italians of
those days considered themselves citizens&mdash;not of Italy
as a whole&mdash;but of their particular cities; people coming
from other cities were looked upon as &ldquo;foreigners,&rdquo;
even though they looked the same, wore the same style
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
of clothing, and spoke the same language!</p>
<p>All the power, influence, and ideas of this period in
history were concentrated within the city-states. A man
might be a very fine artist, engineer, or philosopher, but
unless he managed to bring his work to the attention
of the ruler of one of the cities, he was likely to remain
in obscurity. Thus it was that Piero da Vinci, knowing
that his son would have to have a powerful patron if he
was to succeed at all, brought Leonardo to Florence.</p>
<p>In 1467, when the da Vinci family entered Florence,
the city had been under the rule of the Medici family
for some thirty-three years. As it was in most of these
city-states, the head of the ruling family&mdash;at this time
Piero de&rsquo; Medici&mdash;was in charge of the government of
Florence and the surrounding countryside. But Piero
was fifty-one years old and ailing, and he had only two
years of life left at the time of Leonardo&rsquo;s arrival.</p>
<p class="tb">None of this was in Leonardo&rsquo;s mind as he rode with
his father through one of the great, guarded gates of the
city. He was thinking, not of politics, but of the fabulous
sights that awaited him in this rich center of commerce
and activity.</p>
<p>The narrow streets of the city were so crowded that
is was necessary for the da Vinci family, together with
their servants and the donkeys laden with household
effects, to go single file. Leonardo rode behind his father,
shouting questions, and, at the same time, turning his
head from side to side so as not to miss a thing. Brought
up in the solitude of mountains and valleys, and accustomed
to the quiet life of a village, the boy of fifteen
was overwhelmed with the excitement of the city.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>

<p class="pcap"><i>Leonardo rode behind his father, turning his head from
side to side so as not to miss a thing.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>The party was now making its way past the booths
of hundreds of shops, past magnificent palaces built by
wealthy merchants, and across squares filled with the
produce from hundreds of farms. Every now and then,
Leonardo caught a glimpse of the cathedral dome, one
of the architectural marvels of its day. He had seen the
cathedral with its bell tower and also the towering spire
of the Palazzo della Signoria&mdash;which means the Palace
of the Lords&mdash;from a hill as they approached the city.
This palace still stands and today it is called the Palazzo
Vecchio or Old Palace. But now these sights were lost
to view in the midst of the narrow streets, other
churches, flags, and the lines of washing that seemed to
hang everywhere. Frequently, Piero&rsquo;s party was pressed
against a wall as a procession shoved its way through
a street. Sometimes it was by armed horsemen escorting
a rich banker to some appointment; other times it was
a file of cowled monks observing some saint&rsquo;s day and
carrying huge wax candles before them.</p>
<p>After they had crossed the magnificent square of the
Signoria, in front of the Palace of the same name, Piero
leaned down from his horse and asked a blacksmith
where Verrochio&rsquo;s studio might be. The man shouted
above the din of clanging hammers:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everybody knows that shop, Signor&mdash;it&rsquo;s down that
street and to the right! You can&rsquo;t miss it&mdash;ask anybody!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man was right, for the workshop of Verrochio
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
was not hard to find. Verrochio was considered one of
Florence&rsquo;s finest artists and everybody knew of him.
He was a short, broad-shouldered man of thirty-two
with a round face, shrewd eyes, a thin mouth and dark
curly hair that reached almost to his shoulders. In his
workshop were two other apprentices&mdash;young Pietro
Perugino, who was six years older than Leonardo, and
Lorenzo di Credi, a boy of eight. They all lived in the
house together and, after Leonardo was shown where
he would sleep and had put away the few things he had
brought with him from Vinci, he was taken to the place
where he would work.</p>
<p>Verrochio, whose real name was Andrea di Michele
di Francesco de&rsquo; Cioni, had taken the name of his
teacher, a renowned goldsmith, as was the custom in
the shops at that time. Verrochio himself was a skilled
goldsmith. But to be an artist and to have your own
workshop in the year 1467 meant being a specialist in
many things. Into Verrochio&rsquo;s place came a great variety
of artistic work&mdash;painting pictures, sculpting and
architecture, goldsmithing, designing and making armor,
creating decorated furniture, designing mechanical
toys, and even preparing stage scenery.</p>
<p>Verrochio, of course, would attend to the greater
creative tasks, while his apprentices did the chores of
grinding colors, preparing panels for painting, making
armatures for his sculpture, hewing to size the marble
for a statue, preparing molds for casting, building
models for a new palace or church&mdash;in fact, all the
countless number of preparations to the finished work.
Sometimes, if an apprentice showed extraordinary talent,
he would be allowed to work on the finished painting
or assist with the final strokes of the chisel. Verrochio
was a busy man and a successful artisan. To further
his own ambitions, he was now absorbed in the perfecting
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
of mathematical perspective and the study of geometry.</p>
<p>The curious Leonardo had come to the right man. In
Verrochio&rsquo;s workshop, where so many crafts were
learned at the same time, his powers of observation were
able to develop; his hunger to know about mathematics
was fed. In Verrochio, Leonardo found a teacher who
would encourage these investigations and urge him to
study a wide variety of subjects. Leonardo now felt his
lack of a fuller education. He started to borrow mathematics
textbooks and to seek out men who could teach
him what he needed to know. After each day&rsquo;s work
was over, Leonardo would continue on into the night,
catching up on his neglected studies and discovering
for himself new areas of thought such as anatomy,
movement and weight, botany, and another subject
which was to occupy much of his later years&mdash;<i>hydraulics</i>,
or the useful application of water power.</p>
<p>In these early years, Leonardo commenced his famous
<i>Notes</i>. He had developed his own &ldquo;secret&rdquo; writing
in his childhood at Vinci. These notes&mdash;consisting
of observations, proportions, and reminders to himself&mdash;were
inscribed on his drawings. They were, however,
unreadable to the eye&mdash;until held up to a mirror. Leonardo
was lefthanded and could write fluently in this
strange manner. It could have been for many reasons
that he did so&mdash;perhaps from a natural desire for
secrecy, perhaps for reasons of safety from possible
enemies. In those days, plots and counterplots of all
sorts were commonplace&mdash;a rumor or a whisper in the
right ear could destroy a reputation or financially ruin
a career.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>Leonardo was popular in Florence. He traveled with
the young men of the town, and his handsome appearance
and enormous strength (he could bend a horseshoe
in his hands) made him a welcome figure in many
houses. He continued to play the lute and the lyre. He
wrote poetry, composed his own music, and sang with
a pleasing voice. His blue eyes were kind and his manner
gentle. He always avoided arguments and competition
when he could. When he walked through the marketplace
and came upon the caged birds, he would buy
them&mdash;just to set them free. Indeed, his love of animals
had become so great that he no longer ate meat.</p>
<p>During these years in Verrochio&rsquo;s service, Leonardo
grew in stature as an artist and rapidly developed into
a scientist of promise. He amazed his master when he
painted an angel in an altarpiece that had been assigned
to Verrochio. He painted it in the new oil colors recently
acquired from the Flemish painters. So astounded
was Verrochio with its grace that the master vowed he
would never lift a brush again if a &ldquo;mere child&rdquo; could
so surpass him. In this picture there is a tuft of grass
beside a kneeling figure, also painted by Leonardo,
which indicates by its careful attention to detail the
amount of research he did before committing it to canvas.
In other paintings he made beautiful drawings of
a lily and studies of animals and crabs, giving a hint of
what was to come. For, in these preparatory works,
Leonardo could not be satisfied until he had thoroughly
studied the characteristics of plants and animals in general.
Later in life, he was to become more and more
absorbed in these researches until they occupied the
greater part of his time.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>In 1469, when Leonardo had been in Florence only
two short years, Piero de&rsquo; Medici died and was succeeded
by his son, the mighty Lorenzo de&rsquo; Medici&mdash;or
Lorenzo the Magnificent, as he was often called. Now
the city of Florence felt itself under the control of a
man who really knew how to use power. Lorenzo was
Florence; nothing happened without his making it happen,
and he became one of the most prominent patrons
of art and scholarship in all of Italy. If Leonardo was to
make any headway in Florence, he would have to make
himself noticed by this new Medici ruler.</p>
<p>But Leonardo was not yet worrying about how to
make himself a success. A young man of seventeen and
still an apprentice of Verrochio, Leonardo continued
to meet new friends with new ideas. It was at about this
time that he met Benedetto Aritmetico, a prominent
scholar and mathematician. It is probable that this man
drew Leonardo&rsquo;s attention to the practical needs of
industry and commerce so that some of Leonardo&rsquo;s energy
was directed toward the study and improvement
of existing machinery and the invention of labor-saving
devices. At any rate, during these months Leonardo
was walking the streets of Florence, wandering into
shops and mills, making careful observations of all the
various methods of manufacturing. The more he saw,
the more he thought to himself that one man could do
the work of many&mdash;if only he had the proper machine.
He even made drawings of laborers with picks and
shovels to see if he could determine by mathematics
better ways to swing and hold the tools.</p>
<p>In addition, the particular problems in the engagement
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
of joints fascinated Leonardo, leading him on to
the study of more general problems such as the transmission
of power by gears and the strength of materials.
He also spent long hours studying geometrical theories
and reading Greek and Latin classical works. Laboriously,
he translated these into his own formulas and
made comments about them in his notebooks. He attended
the lectures of John Argyropoulos, a Greek,
who talked of the Aristotelian theories of natural history,
and who had translated Aristotle&rsquo;s <i>Physics</i>.</p>
<p>The study of physics opened to Leonardo a whole
new world of ideas. He experimented with cogwheels,
and with the improvement of ways to lift weights. He
became fascinated with the then-known laws of friction
and built a bench upon which he tested various devices
for the overcoming of frictional drag; he also tested
the natural power of one body to set another in motion.
This bench with its rollers and weights was similar in
principle to the one used by the French physicist A. C.
Coulomb almost three centuries later. Leonardo was
indeed growing into a man of genius. Now everything
from the stars to the flight of an insect occupied his
thoughts.</p>
<p>At the same time, he continued his studies of drawing
and painting. Frequently he was seen in Florence
following someone whose face had interested him&mdash;sometimes
for the better part of the day&mdash;and then at
night he would fill a page with sketches of this same
person from memory.</p>
<p>By developing his powers of observation in this way
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">18</span>
Leonardo came to rely more upon his own experiences
and less upon what he was told or what he read. This
brought him into frequent conflict with the astrologers,
the alchemists and even the Church. The astrologers
were men who told fortunes by the movements of the
stars. The alchemists, with their knowledge of chemistry,
pretended to be able to talk with ghosts and to
tell the future. These men Leonardo held in contempt.
Although he was a devoutly religious man, Leonardo
objected to many attitudes of the Church which he considered
outmoded and which stood in the way of scientific
progress; because of these objections, he was frequently
called a pagan.</p>
<p>In this same year of 1469, Leonardo met the aging
Paolo del Pozzo Toscanelli. Toscanelli was a famous
physician, philosopher and mathematician who, just the
previous year, had marked off on the cathedral floor the
famous meridian line for determining the dates of the
various Church holidays. The old man and the boy became
not only the famous teacher and ardent pupil, but
close friends.</p>
<p>One evening at Toscanelli&rsquo;s house, the old man
showed young Leonardo a globe of the world. Much
of it was marked &ldquo;unknown,&rdquo; but Toscanelli had filled
in some areas from his own careful calculations and
from the stories told him by sailors and travelers. Visions
of distant lands, remote mountain ranges and vast oceans
filled Leonardo&rsquo;s imagination as Toscanelli spoke. Then
Toscanelli tapped the globe to the westward of Spain,
saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here will be found a quicker route to India than
the world has ever known before.&rdquo; Then, turning to
Leonardo he murmured, &ldquo;You will see it happen, my
boy, in your lifetime.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One by one, Leonardo&rsquo;s childhood questions were
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">19</span>
being answered. Toscanelli told him much about the
stars, the fossils of creatures long disappeared from the
world, and how he believed the earth&rsquo;s early formation
took place. He also taught the boy the art of drawing
a map. Not only did Toscanelli greatly influence Leonardo,
but the course of history as well. Ten years after
Toscanelli had died, Christopher Columbus, struggling
westward over the Atlantic Ocean, was using a map
that old Toscanelli had sent him, carefully notated with
all his accumulated wisdom.</p>
<p>Leonardo, in keeping with his own philosophy, tested
all this knowledge with experiments of his own. Because
astronomical instruments were rare, crude, and
costly, Leonardo borrowed them where he could and
later set about making his own. He went on to experiment
with time measurements, devising the first example
of the application of a pendulum to regulate a clock; by
means of two springs, it measured the minutes as well as
the hours. So for the next three years Leonardo worked
in Verrochio&rsquo;s studio and continued his studies and experiments.</p>
<p>In 1472 Leonardo&rsquo;s name was inscribed in the Red
Book of the Painters of Florence, which was the official
<i>guild</i>, or artists&rsquo; union of that time. But he was so poor
that he couldn&rsquo;t afford the dues and hardly had the
money for the necessary candles to be burnt before St.
Luke, the patron saint of all painters. Although his
father now had a spacious apartment in a house on one
of the main squares of Florence, Leonardo continued to
live with Verrochio. In fact, he stayed on past his formal
training period for about four more years, grateful
to the kindly man for the food and bed he offered.</p>

</div>
<p>On Sunday, April 26, 1478, the bells of the cathedral
were ringing loudly over Florence, almost drowning
out the noise of the crowds in the street. Shutters were
being thrown open and people were shouting excited
questions at each other. Distantly at first, but growing in
volume, was another sound&mdash;an ugly one&mdash;the sound
of an approaching, angry mob. Leonardo, holding a roll
of drawings closer under his arm, stopped and listened.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>Suddenly the questioning voices stopped. The bells
continued ringing and now the angry shouts of the mob
could be heard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lorenzo is dead! Giuliano is dead! Death to traitors!
Pazzi! Pazzi!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On to the Palace of the Signoria! They&rsquo;ve captured
the Archbishop! He&rsquo;s a prisoner there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get a ram and we&rsquo;ll break the door down!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The people in the street were caught up in the surging
mass. Already soldiers of the Medici were spreading
out through the city. Cobblestones were ripped
from the street, and swords, knives, and clubs were
being brandished in the air.</p>
<p>Leonardo, backed against a wall of a house, was soon
left in an almost deserted street. Still holding the drawings,
he made his way carefully back to his studio.</p>
<p>As it turned out, Lorenzo was not dead at all.</p>
<p>It was on this Sunday that the Pazzi conspiracy had
broken out in Florence. In the cathedral, the ailing
Giuliano de&rsquo; Medici, brother of Lorenzo, was killed by
assassins. Lorenzo himself escaped with only a scratched
arm. The Pazzi family were rival bankers of the Medicis
and had joined in this plot with Girolamo Riario, a
relative of Pope Sixtus IV, and Francesco Salviati, a
long-time enemy of Lorenzo. A hired professional thug
completed the members of the conspiracy.</p>
<p>Girolamo Riario hated the Medicis because they refused
him money for his own ambitions, and the Pope
opposed Lorenzo because Lorenzo was supporting raids
against papal territory. As for Archbishop Salviati, he
had for years nursed a personal hatred for Lorenzo.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>When the assassination attempt failed, the Archbishop
and Francesco de&rsquo; Pazzi fled to the Palace of the
Signoria for protection. However, the members of the
Council of Florence, who were meeting, then became
suspicious and bolted the doors after them. Both men
were later killed by the Medici followers and their
bodies were hung from the barred windows of the
Palace. In the terror of the days afterward, eighty victims
lost their lives. The Pazzi conspiracy also had an
effect on Leonardo&rsquo;s future, as we shall see later on.</p>
<p>Leonardo had been on his way to the Palace that
morning. He had been given his first painting assignment,
or commission, the previous January. This was to
paint an altarpiece for the chapel of San Bernardo in the
Palace, and just the month before he had received the
sum of twenty-five florins as a partial payment.</p>
<p>Some time before January of 1478, Leonardo had
left Verrochio and had found a place of his own. The
commission had come to Leonardo through the influence
of his father, who was now one of the leading
notaries, or lawyers, of the city. Though still poor,
Leonardo could now devote this new independence to
his widening fields of study.</p>
<p>Leonardo&rsquo;s studio was like his childhood room in one
respect&mdash;it was still filled with all the different things
that had aroused his curiosity. Books were everywhere&mdash;on
his tables and shelves and piled on the floor&mdash;books
by Ptolemy, Pliny, and Strabo on geography and
natural history, by Aristotle on physics, even one by
Guido, a tenth-century monk, who has been called the
father of modern music. In addition, there were books
on arithmetic, agriculture, geometry, grammar, philosophy,
fables, poetry and even one containing jokes. A
map of the world hung on the wall, together with his
drawings; and, scattered throughout the whole studio
were the plants, fossils, rocks and animal skeletons he
<span class="pb" id="Page_24">24</span>
was still collecting from his trips into the country.</p>
<p>There was also a huge table extending down the middle
of Leonardo&rsquo;s studio upon which were many drawings
and instruments for working geometrical problems.
His easel near the window supported a painting&mdash;a
study for his commission in the Palazzo. And on his
desk was a confusion of papers containing notes all
written in his &ldquo;secret&rdquo; writing.</p>
<p>At twenty-six Leonardo was deep in the study of
mechanical law, geometry, and botany. For example, he
had observed the rings in trees and their relationship to
the age of the trees. In mechanics, he was absorbed in
drawing models of a &ldquo;variable speed drive.&rdquo; By meshing
three cogged wheels of different diameters to a common
lantern wheel, Leonardo saw that different speeds
of rotation could be obtained at the same time. This
same principle is used in the gear shift of modern automobiles.
About mechanics Leonardo wrote that it was
&ldquo;the paradise of the mathematical sciences because by
means of it one comes to the fruit of mathematics.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now, too, he was starting to write about his observations
on the flight of birds, the formations of clouds and
the behavior of smoke in the air. He compared the flying
of birds to the swimming of fish in the sea, and the
flow of air to the flow of water. Two hundred years
before Newton, Leonardo would define the principles
of aerodynamic reciprocity, as contained in Newton&rsquo;s
Third Law of Motion.</p>
<p>At this time, Leonardo had an idea for making the
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">25</span>
Arno river navigable all the way from Florence to Pisa
by the addition of canals, thus giving Florence an outlet
to the sea. He also had thoughts for the improvement
of irrigation in order to make use of land that did not
have enough water. Nothing that Leonardo saw in his
day&rsquo;s activities was too small to pass unnoticed and unquestioned.
The flight of a butterfly, the stratification
of rock in a cliffside, the shape of a mighty cumulus
cloud, the turning of a carriage wheel on a bumpy road,
the play of muscles in a farmer&rsquo;s back, the curling of
water around a rock in a stream&mdash;all of these aroused
Leonardo&rsquo;s curiosity. Continually, he studied these
things and painstakingly drew them and wrote about
them in his notebooks.</p>
<p class="tb">Unfortunately, Leonardo&rsquo;s painting commission for
the Palace of the Signoria was never completed. By the
end of the year 1478, the Pope, angered by the killing
of the Archbishop during the Pazzi conspiracy, had declared
war on the Republic of Florence. Ferdinand, the
King of Naples, was persuaded to help in this war against
Florence and the Medicis. As the papal forces were
approaching the fortresses on the Florentine hills, the
Council of Florence discontinued Leonardo&rsquo;s commission
in order to conserve money for the defense of the
city.</p>
<p>Disappointed though he was, Leonardo did not allow
<span class="pb" id="Page_26">26</span>
this setback to discourage him. From a page of drawings
in the Uffizi Gallery of Florence on which are sketched
various arms and war materials, we learn that he turned
from his artistic to his mechanical skills and began designing
engines of war. Besides being a Florentine concerned
with the defense of his city, Leonardo was eager
to gain an appointment with Lorenzo as military engineer
to make up for the painting commission he had
just lost. Also, as the fifteenth century was a turning
point in the methods of waging war, Leonardo was
attracted to all the mechanical possibilities of the new
artillery. Before then soldiers had used spears, bows and
arrows, and stone-throwing catapults, among other primitive
methods. One of Leonardo&rsquo;s designs included a
light cannon whose barrel could be raised or lowered to
proper elevation by means of a hand-cranked screw and
whose horizontal direction could be determined by a
maneuverable cradle.</p>
<p>The military appointment that Leonardo hoped for
didn&rsquo;t come. Unfortunately for the Medicis, the war
with the papal forces was being lost. One by one, the
fortresses under siege surrendered; more and more of
the Florentine troops were fleeing.</p>
<p>Leonardo continued the work on his military machines
for, although he was having some success painting
Madonnas for private homes and had even received
a commission from the King of Portugal for a tapestry
design, he still wanted official recognition for his inventions
from Lorenzo de&rsquo; Medici.</p>
<p>During these weeks late in the year of 1479, Leonardo
conceived many ingenious devices to wage war.
Besides the small artillery piece, he designed a <i>bombard</i>,
or rock-throwing cannon, which did not recoil when
it was fired. This was followed by a light gun arranged
in three tiers of barrels, mounted so that while one tier
was fired, the second was being loaded and the third
was cooling (a forerunner of the modern machine
gun). Another was a device to repel enemy ladders.
It consisted of a horizontal beam laid parallel to the
top of a fortress wall; the beam could be pushed outward
by one man or several men using a system of
<span class="pb" id="Page_27">27</span>
pulleys.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig4">
<img src="images/pg020.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="344" />
<p class="pcap"><i>Leonardo&rsquo;s design for a machine gun. It had thirty-three
barrels in three banks of eleven each. While one bank was
fired, one cooled and the other was reloaded.</i></p>
</div>
<p>Unfortunately for Leonardo, just as he was ready to
show these inventions to Lorenzo de&rsquo; Medici, the last
fortress outside Florence surrendered and a three-month
truce followed. Lorenzo himself went to Naples and
persuaded King Ferdinand to withdraw from the war.
By 1480, peace returned once again to Florence.</p>
<p>As for the Medicis, military machines no longer interested
them. Greatly disappointed at not having his inventions
used&mdash;or even looked at&mdash;Leonardo began to
search about for new fields of creative activity.</p>

<br /><i>Years Of Frustration</i></h2>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="49" />
</div>
<p>The old monk spread the papers out before him on the
table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Master Leonardo,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;these are the terms of
the commission. We at the monastery wish to have an
altarpiece painted for our chapel. Your father has recommended
you, and, as you know, he is our lawyer. Of
course your reputation has already reached our ears, and
we are satisfied in our choice.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>The year was 1480. The monk represented the monastery
of San Donato a Scopeto near the Porta Romana,
just outside Florence. Leonardo shook his head slowly
at the terms of the commission. The painting had to be
completed in thirty months at the most. Moreover, he
must pay for his own colors and even&mdash;Leonardo
looked up as if to protest but resumed reading&mdash;even
pay for any gold or gold leaf he might use. Nevertheless,
it was an opportunity, and Leonardo needed work.
Since the papal war had ended, he had not received any
commissions&mdash;and his skill at military engineering was
still too unknown to have won him recognition.</p>
<p>Although Lorenzo de&rsquo; Medici was a great supporter
of the arts and sciences, he had not granted Leonardo
any of his patronage. In Lorenzo&rsquo;s court were many
men with much book-learning but little talent. They
guarded their positions jealously and kept the way to
Lorenzo barred to any applicant whom they did not
like. Of them, Leonardo wrote in his notes: &ldquo;They strut
about puffed up and pompous, decked out and adorned,
not with their own labors, but by those of others, and
they will not even allow me my own. And if they
despise me who am an inventor, how much more blame
be given to themselves, who are not inventors but trumpeters
and reciters of the work of others?&rdquo;</p>
<p>In accepting the commission to paint the altarpiece,
Leonardo hoped to attract attention to himself. Perhaps
then Lorenzo might welcome him to his court and grant
him patronage. So, with his usual thoroughness, Leonardo
set about the task of preparing an Adoration of
the Magi&mdash;a favorite subject of that time. This was to
be a picture of the Holy Family surrounded by the
three wise men from the East, shepherds and animals,
old and young, rich and poor, paying their adoration to
<span class="pb" id="Page_30">30</span>
the Christ child.</p>
<p>Since he wanted his subjects perfect in every detail,
Leonardo set about drawing countless youths, old men,
sheep, oxen, horses, and donkeys. In a separate drawing
for the background, he worked out with mathematical
mastery the problems of perspective, that is, drawing
objects to make them appear three-dimensional and
either close or far away in space. In addition, he made
studies for the composition of the whole picture&mdash;studies
in which his knowledge of geometry was used to
heighten the excitement of this great religious subject.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig5">
<img src="images/pg022.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="486" />
<p class="pcap"><i>Leonardo&rsquo;s hygrometer.</i></p>
</div>
<p>Among these sketches that Leonardo made for his
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">31</span>
&ldquo;Adoration of the Magi&rdquo; is a page on which appears an
inspiration for one of his greatest masterpieces&mdash;a drawing
of the &ldquo;Last Supper.&rdquo; And on this same page is another
drawing&mdash;one of a hygrometer. A hygrometer is
an instrument for measuring the amount of moisture
in the air. Leonardo&rsquo;s design consists of a simple, graded
disk with a balanced pointer, weighted at one end with
sand and at the other with a sponge or some salt. As the
sponge or salt absorbed the moisture in the air, the
added weight was indicated on the graded disk, thus
measuring the amount of humidity.</p>
<p>Leonardo&rsquo;s researches for the altar painting took him
almost a year. Although the monks began to grumble at
his slowness, Leonardo would not be hurried. He was
determined to produce a painting that was perfect in
all respects. To quiet their impatience Leonardo did
odd jobs for them in the cloister. He repainted their old
clock and for this extra work they advanced him some
much-needed money. In March of 1481 Leonardo was
ready to begin the actual drawing for the altarpiece.
As he progressed with the composition, the monks
crowded around with exclamations of delight. So different
was it from all the other Adoration pictures they
had ever seen, that the monks sent Leonardo some sacks
of corn as a token of their appreciation.</p>
<p>One day, Leonardo was walking slowly toward the
monastery over the Ponte Vecchio&mdash;the Old Bridge&mdash;across
the Arno River. He made his way slowly up the
hill past the construction for the new Pitti Palace. The
morning was hot and the farmers moving into the city
with their heavily laden carts were short-tempered.
Leonardo stood to one side as he watched a pair of oxen
straining to haul a wagon up a rise in the road. Their
owner, his shirt unbuttoned to the waist, was shouting
angrily, lashing the animals with his leather-thonged
whip. It was a cruel sight and Leonardo turned away.
From some experiments he had been making, Leonardo
realized that the poor animals were struggling not only
with the hill, but the drag of friction on the creaking
axle. This drag could be eased, he thought to himself,
by simply resting the axle in two sets of roller-bearings
attached to the bottom of the cart near each wheel. In
his mind he formed the plan for such a model as he
<span class="pb" id="Page_32">32</span>
made his way to the monastery.</p>
<p>The drawing of the altarpiece was nearing completion.
The monks were fascinated by the spectacle of
the Adoration appearing before their eyes. The soft,
umber outlines deepened with gray, the ochre highlighting
the central figures charmed them and they sent another
gift to Leonardo&rsquo;s house&mdash;a cask of Tuscan red
wine.</p>
<p class="tb">As it turned out, Leonardo never finished this altarpiece.
It is not known why. But the drawing for it can
be seen today in the Uffizi Gallery in Florence just as
Leonardo left it.</p>
<p>It is certain, however, that Leonardo was far from
idle during this time. He drew the design for eliminating
the friction of a turning axle by mounting the axle in
roller-bearings. He experimented with, and solved the
problem of, transmitting motion to revolving machine
parts by friction&mdash;the possible forerunner of our modern
friction clutch. Another device, found in modern
automobiles&mdash;the differential&mdash;was also drawn by Leonardo.
This idea provided for the difference in speed
between the two drive wheels when rounding a curve.</p>
<p>Leonardo also drew the first known plans for a self-propelled
<span class="pb" id="Page_33">33</span>
vehicle&mdash;an &ldquo;automobile.&rdquo; It was designed to
operate by a system of elastic springs wound by hand
by the person on the vehicle; the &ldquo;car&rdquo; was then supposed
to run the short distance allowed it by the unwinding
of the springs.</p>
<p>In addition, Leonardo continued designing machines
for both offensive and defensive military action. One of
these was a breech-loading cannon, together with the
first known projectiles that took into consideration better
penetration through the air and greater stability in
their trajectory. Indeed, these very much resembled
present-day aerial bombs, with pointed noses and stabilizing
fins.</p>
<p>As the months passed, however, Leonardo began to
feel that his time and talents were being wasted in Florence.
Although the monks and friends of the monastery
were pleased with the work he was doing, other artists
were being called to greater tasks in Rome. For example,
Domenico di Tommaso del Ghirlandaio, Sandro Botticelli,
and even Leonardo&rsquo;s fellow student, Pietro Perugino,
had left Florence to work in the chapel of Pope
Sixtus IV in Rome&mdash;known to us as the Sistine Chapel.
Now, too, it was becoming clear that Lorenzo and his
court had no time for this solitary genius whose ideas
stretched beyond his age.</p>
<p>So Leonardo looked about him. He was thirty years
old and the walls of Florence seemed to bind his spirit.
To what city could he go where his talents would be
put to fruitful use? Rome seemed to hold out no hope,
for no one had offered him a position there.</p>
<p>But Leonardo remembered that there had been a visitor
<span class="pb" id="Page_34">34</span>
to the Medicis from another city in recent months.
This man was Ludovico Sforza, the ruling prince of
Milan, the great city-state of the north. Ludovico, who
was also called &ldquo;Il Moro&rdquo; (the Moor) because of his
dark complexion, was seeking the friendship and alliance
of the Medicis. He was fascinated with the art
and culture of Florence and sought to gather to his own
court of Milan as many artists, scientists, philosophers,
and musicians as he could.</p>
<p>Perhaps, thought Leonardo, his future lay in Milan.
So he began collecting his countless drawings, diagrams
of machines and instruments of war, his notes, his plans
for canals and irrigation&mdash;even a drawing for a monument
that he knew Ludovico wanted to erect to his
father&mdash;and made a package of it to send to Ludovico.
Then he sat down to write a letter to that nobleman.
In it he set forth in ten numbered paragraphs his qualifications
as military and naval engineer, architect, and
hydraulics expert. Almost as an afterthought to the
tenth item, he wrote: &ldquo;I can carry out sculpture in
marble, bronze, or clay, and also I can do in painting
whatever may be done, as well as any other, be he who
he may.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When he had finished the letter, Leonardo took out
a strange instrument. It was a lyre of silver in the shape
of a horse&rsquo;s head. He had designed it himself, and now
with an air of peace, he commenced to play. Its rich
tone was sweet to hear and the music was his own composition.</p>
<p>Leonardo had also designed other instruments&mdash;lyres,
<span class="pb" id="Page_35">35</span>
lutes, viols, and a kind of zither. He had perfected the
single-stringed monochord of Pythagoras, replacing the
tablet of wood with thin strips of drum that gave the
instrument a low or high note according to the tightness
of the string. In addition, he introduced stops or small
pistons in the holes of wooden reed instruments; and,
he had even invented a set of mechanical chords by
using a wheel of reeds which plucked a set of strings as
it was turned. His skill as a musician, composer, and
singer was well known among his friends and his bass
voice had retained the pureness of his boyhood.</p>
<p>As it happened, news of Leonardo&rsquo;s silver lyre had
reached Lorenzo de&rsquo; Medici. All Leonardo&rsquo;s paintings,
all his designs for cannons and fortifications, all his inventions
for commercial machinery had failed to interest
Lorenzo&mdash;yet this single musical oddity excited the
ruler&rsquo;s curiosity. Leonardo was summoned to the
Medici palace.</p>
<p>Lorenzo was enchanted both by the instrument and
Leonardo&rsquo;s musical talent. When Leonardo had finished
playing, Lorenzo, surrounded by members of his court,
applauded and said,</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would please us if Master Leonardo da Vinci
would present us with this beautiful instrument so that
we, in turn, could make a gift of it to His Highness,
Ludovico Sforza, of Milan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leonardo bowed and replied,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your Grace&rsquo;s request is my pleasure. Moreover, Sire,
it would further that pleasure to bear the gift myself to
His Excellency in Milan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The idea delighted Lorenzo. He immediately directed
that Leonardo be given a letter to Ludovico and that
every protection be given Leonardo for his journey.</p>
<p>Leonardo, with the silver lyre and the letter of recommendation,
hurried home to make his final preparations.
He called on a friend and pupil, young Atalante
Migliorotti, to accompany him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p>Toward the end of 1482 or the beginning of 1483,
with the letter to Ludovico folded in a leather pouch,
Leonardo and Atalante mounted their horses and left
Florence for the long journey to Milan.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="small">5</span>
<br /><i>Milan</i></h2>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="49" />
</div>
<p>Milan at this time was one of the greatest and wealthiest
city-states in all Europe. Its battlements and the
spires of its mighty cathedral rose impressively from the
lush plain of Lombardy. Towering over the city in the
distance were the snow-capped peaks of the Alps.
Groves of mulberry trees for the production of its famous
silk industry and vast stretches of rice paddies
extended far into the surrounding countryside.</p>
<p>Leonardo and Atalante rode along the embankment
<span class="pb" id="Page_38">38</span>
of one of the many canals. The sight of the city hastened
their pace although the journey had been a long
one. Frequently on the trip Leonardo had stopped to
make notes. Riding over the mountains and ravines surrounding
Florence he had drawn some of the rushing
streams and the stratifications of exposed cliffs. And
when they had descended to the plains he observed the
irrigation ditches and made notes on ways of improving
the crude systems of dams and waterwheels.</p>
<p>Leonardo was excited by this new city and by his
prospects at the court of Ludovico. On the way to his
lodgings, he also noticed that Milan was a great center
of arms manufacture. Shop after shop displayed its
wares of swords, spears, shields, armor for man and
horse, and signs advertising foundries for the making of
cannon. Perhaps here he might find an outlet for his
military inventions.</p>
<p>In the inn where he and Atalante stayed, Leonardo
overheard the current political rumors. All around him
was talk of the war. Girolamo Riario was again in the
field, and Ludovico&rsquo;s ally, Alfonso of Calabria, had just
been defeated by the Venetians in a bloody battle at
Campo Morto.</p>
<p>Leonardo reread the letter he had written setting
forth his own accomplishments and decided that now
was the time to present himself as a military engineer.
He would minimize the bronze monument, his music,
and his painting, and instead, he would stress his skills
in the inventions of war.</p>
<p>When Leonardo appeared before Ludovico, he was a
<span class="pb" id="Page_39">39</span>
handsome young man of thirty-one. Tall and strong, he
was dressed not according to fashion, but simply&mdash;almost
severely. His hair hung in curls on his shoulders
and his auburn mustache and neatly trimmed beard accented
his ruddy complexion and deep-set blue eyes.
Indeed, he presented a striking contrast to the nobleman
seated before him. Il Moro, with his dark skin
and straight black hair, his richly embroidered doublet
with its broad sleeves and the heavy gold chains
across his thick chest, was the exact opposite of Leonardo.</p>
<p>Ludovico set aside Leonardo&rsquo;s letter, rose from his
chair, and walked to the heavy table on which Leonardo
had spread out his drawings.</p>
<p>Plans for all manner of war machines were there&mdash;those
that Leonardo had designed for Lorenzo de&rsquo; Medici
without success, together with many new additions.
For example, there were plans for a self-propelled bomb
with flames to be shot out in all directions&mdash;a bomb
that was later to be called a &ldquo;rotatory rocket&rdquo; when it
was actually invented in 1846. Leonardo also explained
to Ludovico his idea for &ldquo;poison gas&rdquo; bombs containing
sulfur: the fumes of these bombs would &ldquo;produce
stupor,&rdquo; and they could be used both on land and sea,
together with masks to protect those who were using
them. Shrapnel shells, hand grenades, and javelins that
burst into flame when they struck their objectives&mdash;these
and many more were among his ideas.</p>
<p>But perhaps the most unusual to Ludovico&rsquo;s eyes was
the design for an armored vehicle. It was shaped like
a giant turtle, with overlapping sheets of reinforced
wood so that enemy shells would bounce off its surface.
The armor was pierced by loopholes for the breech-loading
cannon and there was an opening at the top for
ventilation. Power for the vehicle was supplied by eight
men inside turning cranks which in turn were cogged
to other wheels, setting in motion the four drive wheels.
This of course was the forerunner of the tank and the
<span class="pb" id="Page_40">40</span>
armored car used in modern warfare.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig6">
<img src="images/pg027.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="287" />
<p class="pcap"><i>Forerunner of the tank or armored car, as conceived by
Leonardo. Motion was supposed to be supplied by four
cogged wheels turned by manpower. Sheets of reinforced
wood were supposed to serve as &ldquo;armor&rdquo; against enemy
projectiles.</i></p>
</div>
<p>In addition, Leonardo laid before Ludovico all manner
of cannons and designs for tunneling under the enemy&rsquo;s
defenses. Actually, with respect to warfare itself,
Leonardo called it a most brutal &ldquo;madness&rdquo;; however,
he recognized the necessity of being prepared. In his
notebook, he wrote, &ldquo;When besieged by ambitious
tyrants I find a means of offense and defense in order to
preserve the chief gift of nature, which is liberty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ludovico was very much interested in the things
Leonardo had showed him. Although he was a man of
limited imagination and was not able to grasp the scope
of Leonardo&rsquo;s proposals, he was nevertheless involved
in a war. Since Ludovico&rsquo;s aging military engineer was
to be replaced, Leonardo left the forbidding castle of
the Sforzas with high hopes of getting the position.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>In the meantime, he was commissioned to paint the
portrait of a young girl from a noble family in Milan.
At the same time, he began the bronze equestrian statue
of Ludovico&rsquo;s father, Francesco Sforza. For this work,
he began an intensive study of horses. Since hunting was
the popular sport at the court of the Sforzas, Ludovico
owned a stable of the finest Arabian horses, and here
Leonardo commenced his drawings. Again, his research
for a work of art led him beyond just making preparatory
sketches. His studies developed into notes, and his
notes into a planned book on the anatomy of the horse.</p>
<p>During these months of waiting for the appointment
as military engineer, Leonardo furthered his experiments
with cannon. In the course of these experiments, he came
across a power that would later revolutionize all industry&mdash;steam.
He devised&mdash;although he attributed the
original idea to Archimedes&mdash;a water vessel connected
to a copper tube which was heated by a fire. The water
when flowing into the red-hot tube changed into steam
and the pressure of the steam blew out a ball at the
mouth of the tube with great force. Leonardo experimented
with steam in other ways. He built an apparatus
for measuring the transformation of water into vapor.
It consisted of a metal box in which was a thin animal
bladder partly filled with water. Resting on the top of
the bladder was a flat lid attached by a cord hung from
two pulleys to a counterweight on the outside. As the
water was heated, the steam in the bladder pushed up
the lid. As the lid rose both the volume and the pressure
could be measured. There were distillation experiments
with various condensers, one in particular that anticipated
the modern condenser of Leibig, introducing double
walls that formed a complete jacket for cooling with
<span class="pb" id="Page_42">42</span>
water in continual circulation.</p>
<p>Not content with having an idle moment, Leonardo
again turned to searching out books that he had not
read and trying to fill the gaps in his education. He became
especially interested in the German philosopher,
Cardinal Cusanus. Cusanus, like himself, had been influenced
by Toscanelli and was a man devoted to the
natural sciences. Leonardo also studied the philosophy of
Aristotle and the writings of St. Augustine. Throughout
his life Leonardo believed in an active mind for, as &ldquo;iron
rusts from disuse, stagnant water loses its purity and in
cold weather becomes frozen, even so does inaction sap
the vigor of the mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the post of military engineer went to
a man named Ambrogio Ferrari. The extent and variety
of Leonardo&rsquo;s proposals were too great for Ludovico to
trust. He did not believe that one man could possibly
bring all those ideas into being. Ferrari, on the other
hand, was a military engineer only, and a man who was
content with the customary methods of warfare. Furthermore,
Ludovico had at last decided that peaceful
negotiations would gain him more than fighting.
Thus Leonardo&rsquo;s chance of recognition was again postponed.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the money that Leonardo had brought
with him from Florence was almost gone. He had been
forced to move from his apartment to a single room and
now he was barely able to live from day to day. Although
the court of Ludovico Sforza was one of the
richest in the world, artists were frequently treated as
servants; often they were the last to be paid for their
services. Also, Leonardo was a foreigner in the city,
<span class="pb" id="Page_43">43</span>
which meant he was regarded with suspicion.</p>
<p>Because of these reasons, Leonardo finally decided to
do what the Milanese artists did&mdash;they banded together
in groups sharing work and costs. Leonardo had met a
young artist of twenty-eight, Giovanni Ambrogio de
Predis, at the court of Ludovico. Ambrogio was court
painter to the Sforza family and had achieved some success.
Ambrogio recognized in the handsome stranger
from Florence, however, the touch of genius, and he realized
that his own talents would be furthered by learning
from Leonardo. The two young men decided to
pool their abilities. Ambrogio offered both lodging and a
studio; and, in association with his two half-brothers,
one a woodcarver, another a miniaturist, and his elder
brother, a minter of coins, they would not lack for commissions.</p>
<p>Commissions weren&rsquo;t long in coming. On April 25,
1483, a contract was signed between Bartolommeo degli
Scarlione, a prior of the Fraternity of the Immaculate
Conception, and Ambrogio and Leonardo for an altarpiece.
The fee was two hundred ducats, with a promise
of more if it were delivered on time and was satisfactory
to the Fraternity. Delivery date was to be December
8, 1484. Ambrogio was to paint the altar wings and
Leonardo the center piece&mdash;a picture of the Blessed
Virgin and Child.</p>
<p>But when the painting was finished, it was not according
<span class="pb" id="Page_44">44</span>
to the instructions set forth in the contract. Leonardo
had too independent a mind to be bound by conformity.
Nor was it completed on time. Indeed, for
twenty years the quarrel between the Fraternity and
the painters went on. After ten years, Ludovico was
asked to intervene for the money owed; after he failed,
another ten years went by and the King of France himself
was finally asked to settle the dispute. Leonardo
wanted his one hundred ducats and the Fraternity offered
twenty-five. Eventually, a secret agreement was
arrived at and the painting was restored to Leonardo
and Ambrogio. Leonardo&rsquo;s painting, the masterpiece entitled
the &ldquo;Virgin of the Rocks,&rdquo; now hangs in the museum
of the Louvre in Paris.</p>
<p>The day this contract was signed, Leonardo walked
back through the city to Ambrogio&rsquo;s studio near the
Ticino gate. He was low in spirits from reading the
petty instructions of the contract, and, in this mood, he
became aware of the city streets and crowds about him.
The noise, the confusion, the smells&mdash;yes, the smells
were the worst. Garbage, filth, and dust were in heaps
where the last rainwater had left them and they buzzed
with flies.</p>
<p>Moreover the houses were jammed together and shopkeepers
crowded their wares to the edges of the streets,
leaving just enough room for the occasional horseman
to get through. Latrines were only for the better houses;
here, the streets, alleys and even open doorways were
toilets. People flung their scraps out of the window and
at night in the poorly lit streets could be heard the
scurrying of rats. Leonardo stopped, thinking half
aloud:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two levels. Streets running one above the other&mdash;one
<span class="pb" id="Page_45">45</span>
for pedestrians and one for carts and horses. Yes,
and cutting through the whole city a system of canals
to carry the city&rsquo;s waste to a river or to the sea. Why not
even ten cities of, say, five thousand houses in each&mdash;say,
no more than thirty thousand people to a city?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Intent now on his thoughts he hurried to his home,
his mind busy with his visions of new cities.</p>
<p class="tb">During the years 1484 and 1485 the bubonic plague
swept Italy&mdash;the same dreaded Black Death so prevalent
in medieval times. Milan was one of the cities most
severely stricken. Every courtyard became a hospital
and the streets were deserted except for the rumbling
carts picking up the dead. On the roads from the city
were lines of refugees fleeing to the country. Surrounding
cities that had not been infected manned their fortress
walls as in wartime to keep the fleeing populations
out.</p>
<p>Ludovico at first tried to protect Milan from the
spread of the disease; then, frightened, he and his court
fled. Even the ruler&rsquo;s official documents had to be &ldquo;disinfected&rdquo;
by perfume and then held for a period of
time before he would allow them near him.</p>
<p>Leonardo, sensing opportunity, drew out his plans for
his new cities. Canals running through them were to be
used for barges and the underground conduits greatly
resembled those of modern sewage systems. Paths were
to have gutters for the adequate drainage of the streets.
Public toilets were to be installed. Leonardo even had
plans for the control of smoke collecting over the city&mdash;by
sending it up tall chimneys where it was picked up
by fans and driven away over the roofs. The widths of
the streets were to be in proportion to the heights of the
houses&mdash;light and air would circulate freely. Two levels
would be connected by graceful ramps&mdash;the lower level
for the commercial traffic and the upper level for the
pedestrians. Where stairs were used they were designed
so one could ascend or descend without one person
seeing the other. Stables were devised so that animals
were fed through openings in their mangers and under
these were tunnels of flowing water for the removal of
waste.</p>

<p class="pcap"><i>The results of the bubonic plague in Italy, 1484-85. Streets

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<p>These sweeping plans Leonardo laid before Ludovico
when the epidemic had subsided. But Ludovico, once
his fear was overcome, brushed them aside as impossible
dreams.</p>
<p>So Leonardo returned to the commission for the Fraternity
and the designs for the bronze monument of
Francesco Sforza. These jobs kept Leonardo from
brooding about his rejections.</p>
<p>Often, too, Leonardo worked with Bernardino de
Predis, the elder brother of Ambrogio. Bernardino was
a minter of coins. As Leonardo watched him at the
laborious task of first cutting disks from ingots and
then hammering the design into the hot metal, he suggested
to Bernardino an easier method, then used in
Germany. This was to prepare smooth ribbons of metal
of the desired thickness and with a punch, impress
the design into the ribbon at the necessary intervals and
then, punch out the coin. Leonardo went on to improve
this system by designing precise punches for both faces
of the coin. A single machine then cut out and stamped
the coins, using a falling weight raised by little winches.
This machine was later destined for the Vatican mint in
Rome.</p>
<p>On March 26, 1485 an event occurred in Milan that
<span class="pb" id="Page_48">48</span>
was viewed with mingled fear, superstition, curiosity
and excitement. There was a total eclipse of the sun. To
some, coming as it did so soon after the plague, it was
a judgment of God; to others, it was regarded as an
omen&mdash;a sign for astrologers to use for predicting the
future.</p>
<p>But to Leonardo the eclipse was a moment of great
scientific importance. At this time in history, the Ptolemaic,
or geocentric theory of the universe was the popular
belief. This theory taught that the earth is fixed and
the sun and moon revolve around it. Leonardo himself
had believed this theory for a long time. As he grew
older, however, he read and heard discussions of the
heliocentric theory. This theory proposed that the sun
is fixed and the earth and stars move around it. Now,
as he watched the eclipse, his doubts of the Ptolemaic
concept were renewed and he resolved to make experiments
of his own. The new theory was so daring for his
times, however, that it would be many years before he
became convinced of its truth.</p>
<p>Later that night, deep in thought over the experience
of the day, he noted down his observations of the eclipse
and his doubts of the medieval concept of the heavens.
The Church believed the earth was the fixed center of
the universe. Scholars and scientists supported the belief
of Aristotle in the four elements, earth, water, air, and
fire&mdash;but something was wrong. What were the planets&mdash;what
was the moon? He picked up his pen and on a
clean sheet of paper he wrote, &ldquo;Make glasses in order
to see the moon large.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="small">6</span>
<br /><i>The Monument</i></h2>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="49" />
</div>
<p>During this time, Leonardo had been struggling with
the design for the bronze equestrian statue. Drawing
after drawing lay scattered on his studio floor. Lately,
however, a daring plan for this statue had come to him.
It was to be a huge bronze warrior, Francesco Sforza,
mounted on a rearing horse. Weighing perhaps a hundred
thousand pounds, it was to be cast in sections in
five furnaces&mdash;a fitting monument to the power of the
Sforza family. But there still remained a big problem to
be solved: how could he balance the plunging horse and
<span class="pb" id="Page_50">50</span>
man on just the two rear legs of the horse?</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Leonardo had another problem to work
on&mdash;a wooden model of the Milan cathedral. He had
entered his name with the cathedral authorities as a competitor
in the design and construction of the cathedral&rsquo;s
dome. Many architects had been brought in and had
failed, partly because of the antagonism of the Milanese
workmen to foreign craftsmen, and partly because the
committee found it difficult to decide what designs it
liked. Leonardo had sent them a letter outlining his own
recommendations and had drawn many pages of possible
plans. He put forward his knowledge of various
building materials, his understanding of classical architecture,
and his wish to keep his own ideas in harmony
with the Gothic tradition of the cathedral itself. Often
he would make a point of walking about the city, observing
the different constructions under way and drawing
up plans to shorten the labor by mechanical means.</p>
<p>In July of 1487 Leonardo received a payment from
the cathedral authorities for the wooden model he had
submitted. Still, however, no final decision had been
reached. Now, as Leonardo looked at the model in his
studio, he felt the urge to improve it further&mdash;to make
it more perfect. Yet he held his impatience in check and
decided he would wait a little longer. Instead, he decided
to work on some of his ideas for construction devices.
He had already made many drawings, but they could
be improved, he thought, and he began to make calculations.</p>
<p>Among these notes and drawings was an improvement
<span class="pb" id="Page_51">51</span>
on a device for the raising of columns. It was a
mobile windlass with a transmission gear for transporting
and erecting columns and obelisks. Another device
was an earth drill resembling a modern corkscrew with
double handle bars. The upper bar, when turned, drilled
the screw into the earth while the lower bar&mdash;when
turned the opposite way&mdash;carried the dirt up and out.
Also there was a double crane mounted on a circular
trolley which carried the dirt of excavation up and then
the crane was moved around on its trolley so the dirt
could be unloaded in different directions.</p>
<p>Other labor-saving devices that Leonardo designed
were an automatic pile driver, the weight of which was
raised by a winch and tripped automatically at its height
to fall on the piling; a lift for raising iron bells to bell
towers; and a machine for boring tree trunks to make
pipes for carrying water.</p>
<p>In the fall of 1488, Leonardo was interrupted by a
summons from Ludovico, who wanted him to design
and build the decorations for the forthcoming marriage
of his nephew, young Duke Gian Galeazzo Sforza, to
Isabella of Aragon, granddaughter of the King of Naples.
He worked on this steadily until the wedding
ceremony in February of the following year. When the
day arrived, the street from the cathedral to the grim
castle was trimmed with flags and banners of the two
royal houses. The inner courtyards of the castle were
transformed into delicate arbors of laurel boughs. Yet it
was the evening&rsquo;s reception and entertainment which
were to be the climax and to them Leonardo had brought
all his mechanical skill. However, the announcement of
the death of the bride&rsquo;s mother cut short the celebration
and, after the bride and groom had left for Pavia, the
wedding party soon dispersed. Disappointed that his
decorations had not been fully appreciated, Leonardo
<span class="pb" id="Page_52">52</span>
returned to his studio and the problem of the monument.</p>
<p>He was still struggling with the problem of balancing
the rearing horse. And, indeed, a solution was soon
found. By placing a fallen soldier with his arm upraised
in protection under the forefeet of the horse, Leonardo
could balance the enormous weight and provide for
the proper casting of the molten bronze.</p>
<p>Finally, Leonardo made a small wax model of the
proposed statue and showed it to Ludovico. The nobleman
was impressed by its originality. Most of the ideas
contributed by other sculptors were mere variations of
what had already been done many times. Also, the other
plans called for bronze of not more than two thousand
pounds, while Leonardo envisioned a statue fifty times
that size! Ludovico awarded the commission to Leonardo.</p>
<p>Leonardo was to work on this commission for ten
years and it was destined never to be immortalized in
bronze, for reasons that will be explained later. His
energies, as usual, were poured into many schemes.
Growing out of his work on the monument he planned
one book on the subject of casting in bronze and another
on the anatomy of the horse. But the one subject,
which he began to study in this period and which would
occupy the remainder of his life, was the study of human
anatomy. So Leonardo, in the midst of all his other activities,
wrote in his notes, &ldquo;On the second day of April
1489 the book entitled <i>Of the Human Figure</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sources of anatomical study up to Leonardo&rsquo;s
<span class="pb" id="Page_53">53</span>
day had been the Greeks&mdash;Hippocrates and Galen&mdash;and
the Arab&mdash;Avicenna. Books on this subject were
few, and the anatomical diagrams were crude and inaccurate.
Galen, for example, had based his studies on the
dissection of monkeys. Renaissance anatomists had explained
his errors by pointing out that man had probably
changed since Galen&rsquo;s time. The Church had stepped
in during the fourteenth century with an edict that was
interpreted as a prohibition against dissection of the
human body. In Italy, however, there were some dissections.
They could only use, for this purpose, the
bodies of criminals, slaves, and people of foreign birth.
In Florence, anatomy was studied by the artists, and
Leonardo had undoubtedly watched Pollaiuolo at work
on a corpse that that artist had dissected.</p>
<p>In 1489 Leonardo, from the results of his own investigation,
produced drawings of the skull and backbone
whose careful attention to detail are&mdash;even today&mdash;classics
in art and anatomy. With infinite patience and
with a saw of his own invention he had halved a skull
and drew for the first time with accuracy the curves of
the frontal and sphenoid bones. He drew the lachrymal
(tear) canal, and he was the first to show the cavity in
the superior maxillary bone&mdash;not discovered again until
1651, by Highmore&mdash;now named &ldquo;the antrum of Highmore.&rdquo;
He was the first to demonstrate the double curvature
of the spine and its accompanying vertebrae, the
inclination of the sacrum, the shape of the rib cage, and
the true position of the pelvis. He planned a whole series
of books that would include from head to foot and
from inside to outside every section of the human apparatus.</p>
<p>Meanwhile he had been working on the monument,
<span class="pb" id="Page_54">54</span>
redesigning it to conform to the practical needs of casting.
Now it had reached an even grander scale&mdash;a colossus
that would require two hundred thousand pounds of
bronze! He recorded in his notes the very day that this
work was started, &ldquo;On the twenty-third day of April
1490 I commenced this book and recommenced the
horse.&rdquo; The &ldquo;horse,&rdquo; of course, was the monument and
&ldquo;this book&rdquo; referred to still another subject which had
grown out of his studies of anatomy and perspective.</p>
<p>The title of the proposed book was to be <i>Light and
Shade</i>. It would include the subject of optics or the mechanism
of the eye, the problems of reflection and refraction
and it would lead him eventually to a re-examination
of his studies of the sun and moon.</p>
<p>In Leonardo&rsquo;s day, and even for a long while afterwards,
the popular belief of vision was one that had
originally been put forth by the Platonic school and
expanded by Euclid and Ptolemy. This belief was that
the eye sent forth rays that brought back the image to
the soul. Leonardo, in his younger days, had believed
in the same theory. Not content with what had been
written on the subject, however, he began to experiment
for himself.</p>
<p>These experiments led him to an examination of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_55">55</span>
eye itself. He noted the various parts of the eye&mdash;the
optic foramen or opening, the pigment layer, and the
iris. These were already known by the Arabs. Leonardo
discovered, however, the crystalline area of the eye. He
explained binocular vision, or three-dimensional images,
by correctly noting the positions of the two eyes in the
head. He described the variations in the diameter of the
pupil according to the surrounding light. Further experiments
with light brought him to the conclusion that
light and images are received by the eye. He took a
piece of paper, for example, and pierced it with a small
hole. With this he looked at the source of light. He
noted the cone shape of the rays funneling into the tiny
hole and then when the paper was held next to a white
wall he noted that the rays spread out again. He established
that light travels in straight lines. He constructed
the first &ldquo;camera obscura&rdquo;&mdash;a box with a small hole in
it. Inside the box an object was placed near the hole and
behind that a lighted candle. When the box was closed
the image of the object was cast on the wall. Leonardo
was already acquainted with lenses, and he placed a magnifying
lens over the hole to create an enlarged image.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig8">
<img src="images/pg034.jpg" alt="" width="364" height="321" />
<p class="pcap"><i>Leonardo&rsquo;s &ldquo;camera obscura&rdquo; which he used for projecting
an image of an object on a wall or screen.</i></p>
</div>
<p>He also demonstrated various laws relative to optical
<span class="pb" id="Page_56">56</span>
illusion, such as irradiation&mdash;when a metal rod is made
red-hot at one end, that end seems thicker than the
other. A brightly lit object seems larger than one exactly
like it that is dimly lit; a dark object placed against a
light background seems smaller than it is; a light object
seems larger than its real size when placed against a dark
background; and the illusion of a light swung in a circle
appears as a complete circle of light.</p>
<p>Many years before Newton, Leonardo described the
experiment of breaking up a ray of white light into the
solar spectrum. Also he compared two sources of light
and measured their intensity by the depth of their shadows
accompanied by a drawing that was the forerunner
of Rumford&rsquo;s photometer three centuries later! He
stated the law of reflection&mdash;that is, that the angle of
reflection is always equal to the angle of incidence.</p>
<p class="tb">About this time Leonardo left the studio of Ambrogio
de Predis and moved into the Sforza Castle. Ludovico
had put at his disposal a studio in the Corte Vecchia
and the use of a room in one of the towers&mdash;which
Leonardo always kept locked. To his growing list of
work, Leonardo now had to add the preparations for
the delayed wedding reception of Ludovico&rsquo;s nephew,
Gian Galeazzo Sforza.</p>
<p>On a cold winter evening of January 1490 the guests
assembled again. Silks, satins and gold brocade, diamonds,
rubies and pearls glittered in the brilliant lights.
Princes of the Church mingled with ambassadors of foreign
lands. Music and perfume filled the air and as the
party quieted down the entertainment began. There
were dances in gay costumes. Poetry was recited that
flattered the bride and groom. There were allegorical
processions. The jokes and antics of the court jester
made the audience laugh.</p>
<p>Then, at midnight, the curtain that hung from wall
<span class="pb" id="Page_57">57</span>
to wall at the end of the ballroom was raised. Applause
and cries of delight greeted the spectacle. The rising
curtain revealed a room in which there was a hemisphere
surrounded by the signs of the zodiac and the planets.
While the planets in their niches flickered with concealed
lights and the signs of the zodiac glowed, lines
were spoken in honor of the house of Sforza to the accompaniment
of a choir. The ancient gods swept down
from the heavens, and the Virtues and Graces moved
across the scene with nymphs waving lanterns. The
music drowned out the sound of the mechanism. This
was the kind of mechanics that Ludovico could understand
and appreciate.</p>
<p>The success of this entertainment so pleased Ludovico
that Leonardo was encouraged to present another
amusing idea. This one was an &ldquo;alarm clock&rdquo; and it utilized
what we call today the mechanical relay principle.
When a small power is suddenly switched over, the
power is reinforced. The &ldquo;alarm&rdquo; clock worked by placing
a shallow basin of water at one end of a tubed lever.
At the other end was another empty basin. Water was
led drop by drop into the second basin and as this slowly
filled the increasing weight lowered the lever. The shallow
basin of water at the first end was suddenly emptied
and the immediate switch in weight flipped the lever up
and this in turn pushed up the sleeper&rsquo;s feet.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<p class="tb">Leonardo decided to withdraw from the competition
for the cathedral dome. Although the cathedral authorities
were pleased with his design, they could not decide
to whom the commission should be awarded. In the
summer of 1490 Ludovico was called upon to settle the
issue and he decided in favor of Antonio Amadeo from
Milan. But the work that Leonardo had done so impressed
Ludovico that he sent him to Pavia in company
with an architect from Siena, Francesco di Giorgio
Martini, to inspect the work on the cathedral of that
city. Leonardo, who had his own workshop and apprentices
now, took along one of them, Marco d&rsquo;Oggionno,
a young boy of twenty.</p>
<p>In Pavia one of the greatest libraries in all of Italy was
in the ducal palace. Here Leonardo wandered among
shelves of books and illuminated manuscripts bound in
rich velvets and gold-embossed leather all bound to their
places with silver chains. One book that he records in
his notes was written in the thirteenth century by
Witelo, a Polish scholar, who wrote extensively on perspective.
Leonardo, by the necessity of his art, had
solved many problems in perspective. He had invented
a pair of proportional compasses, the forerunners of
those used today for the transfer of a drawing from one
scale to duplicate the same drawing in a larger scale.
Leonardo had also designed in very careful detail a parabolic
compass for drawing a parabola in one continuous
movement. He now determined to write his own book
on perspective and, as the subject was so close to his
studies of the eye, he would entitle it <i>Introduction to
Perspective, or the Function of the Eye</i>.</p>
<p>Leonardo submitted a number of plans for the completion
of the cathedral to the authorities in Pavia and
then returned to Milan. He worked through the rest of
the summer on the equestrian statue and at the same time
he continued to expand his notes on anatomy, light and
shade, and perspective.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<p>Late on a cold December night in 1490, Leonardo
lit his lamp. This was a very special lamp that he had
invented. It had already created a great deal of comment.
It was so unusual, he had received an order from
the court for another which he made with a richly carved
pedestal. Candles, torches, and oil lamps, the only methods
of artificial illumination in those days, were poor
substitutes for light. They flickered, smoked, went out,
and frequently caused damage with their hot drippings.
As a side result of his experiments in light, Leonardo
had put a glass cylinder in the middle of a larger glass
globe. A wick in olive oil was placed in the cylinder and
the outside globe was then filled with water. The result
was a bright, steady light magnified by the water in the
globe.</p>
<p>He sat down by the small fire and arranged his papers
in front of him. Then, with a glance at his lamp, he
picked up his goose-quill pen and wrote, &ldquo;No substance
can be comprehended without light and shade; light and
shade are caused by light.&rdquo;</p>

<br /><i>Success</i></h2>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="49" />
</div>
<p>It was January of 1491, and a light snow had fallen in
Milan, edging with white all the roofs, the massive
spires of the cathedral and the red battlements of the
Sforza castle. Soon Ludovico was to be married to Beatrice
d&rsquo;Este of the ducal house of Ferrara.</p>
<p>Once more the streets of Milan echoed to the carpenters&rsquo;
hammers. Messengers rode to and from the castle
and endless carts full of provisions pushed through the
crowded city. Guests began to arrive from all the allied
courts of Italy with their bodyguards and servants. The
rooms of the castle, the palaces of the nobles, and even
the inns were filling with the royal processions.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<p>Leonardo was again summoned by the court to prepare
the decorations, the costumes for the masquerades,
and the arena for the jousting tournaments. An invitation
had been sent to all the friendly courts to attend
these contests-at-arms. So, accompanying each new
party&rsquo;s arrival was a band of armored knights, their
breast-plates, helmets, and shields glistening in the winter
sun.</p>
<p>Leonardo enjoyed designing mechanical toys and entertaining
the guests with them. One of these was a mechanical
drum. Ordinarily most of the entertainment
began with normal drum rolls, but Leonardo&rsquo;s rolls were
made on a kind of wheelbarrow. On it was mounted an
enormous drum. When the &ldquo;wheelbarrow&rdquo; was pushed,
it put into motion a cogged wheel geared to the axle.
This wheel in turn was geared to two rotary cylinders
with pegs mounted around the top. The pegs moved
against five drumsticks on either side of the drum and
thumped out a rhythm according to the position of the
pegs.</p>
<p>Ludovico&rsquo;s marriage to Beatrice d&rsquo;Este, a girl of little
more than fifteen years, further isolated Leonardo from
the court. Being almost a child, Beatrice loved parties
and festivities, and she surrounded herself with people
who catered to her frivolous whims. As a result so serious
a man as Leonardo was forced into the background
of the court life. He was called upon more and more
to act as stage-designer while his more important work
went unnoticed. Because these entertainments were easy
for Leonardo to design, they did give him more time to
work on his giant equestrian monument of Francesco
Sforza. Working one day on the scaffolding surrounding
the clay figure of his statue, Leonardo heard a knock
<span class="pb" id="Page_62">62</span>
at his studio door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; he shouted as he climbed down. &ldquo;The
door&rsquo;s open.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Three peasants cautiously entered the room and
quickly took off their caps. One of them was holding a
carefully wrapped bundle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Master Leonardo, we have brought you some shells
we found on a ridge of Monferrato. Remember, you
asked us to bring anything we found that was unusual?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Pietro. Thank you. Put them here on the table.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leonardo opened the bundle. He smiled when he saw
the shells. He remembered how, as a young boy, he had
found seashells like these high in the mountains. Leonardo
questioned Pietro and his companions as to where
they had been found and under what circumstances. He
gave them some coins and, when they had gone, he
looked among his growing collection of notes and drawings
on the shelves. It took some time for him to find
what he wanted, for the pages were in such confusion.
Finally, he sat down at the table with several of the
sheets and, putting the seashells in front of him, he
began to make notes.</p>
<p>The shells were fossil shells but, thought Leonardo,
<span class="pb" id="Page_63">63</span>
their presence on the high mountains of Lombardy
could hardly be attributed to the great flood as described
in the Bible. In his notes, Leonardo cited the
case of the cockle which, out of water, is like the snail.
It makes a furrow in the sand and can travel in this
furrow about three to four yards a day. By such
means, he calculated, it could not possibly have reached
Monferrato from the Adriatic in forty days (which was
supposed to have been the duration of the flood)&mdash;a
distance of 250 miles. Nor were these simply dead shells
deposited by the waves&mdash;for the living creatures are
recognized by being in pairs, and these in front of him
had certainly been traveling in pairs. Consequently, they
could have been left there only when they were alive
and the mountains were covered by the primeval oceans.
Moreover, Leonardo also described how living matter in
prehistoric times fell into the mud and died, and how
this mud, as the waters receded and years had passed,
was changed into rock forming a mold about the fossil&mdash;literally
making a cast of its original living appearance.</p>
<p>By such deductive reasoning and the testing of the
evidence before him against the common beliefs, Leonardo
struggled to free the minds of men from medieval
superstitions and beliefs. Indeed, these medieval superstitions
existed everywhere. Astrologers, or men who told
fortunes by the position of the stars at a given moment;
and necromancers, those who by tricks of magic claimed
to be able to talk to departed spirits&mdash;these men profited
from the ignorant. The Church, with its preaching of
devils and hells, provided the background against which
these fakers flourished.</p>
<p>Ludovico Sforza was himself a believer in such things.
<span class="pb" id="Page_64">64</span>
His own physician and astrologer was a man by the
name of Ambrogio da Rosate, who had such influence
over the court that he was given a post in the University
of Pavia, and his fame was so great that he was called
upon to predict the future of Pope Innocent VIII! Leonardo&rsquo;s
dislike of these men was intense. He scorned the
supernatural and asked men to look about them at the
real world and the real heavens. Observation and experiment&mdash;these
were Leonardo&rsquo;s key words. But he was a
lonely figure in his thinking&mdash;like a man awake while
the rest of the world slept.</p>
<p>At last the full-size model of the Sforza monument
was nearing completion. Ludovico had ordered it ready
for exhibition in the courtyard of the castle for yet another
marriage festival that was soon to take place. This
time it was the marriage of his niece Bianca Maria to
Maximilian I of Germany. Leonardo and his assistants
were busy with the finishing touches on the monument,
and with building a wagon on which to carry it from
the studio to the courtyard.</p>
<p>During these last months Leonardo had had to struggle
with all kinds of heavy loads. Already he had improved
on pulleys by inventing a new kind of tackle,
and he also had utilized many kinds of levers. One of his
simpler discoveries for raising heavy weights was a jack
which, in appearance and principle, was the forerunner
of our own automobile jack.</p>
<p>In 1493 when the clay model of the Sforza monument
was completed, it was put on the cart and wheeled to its
place of exhibition where a curtain was thrown around
it. Again Milan was the host to a gathering of noble
courts, and this time Ludovico outdid himself in the
display of luxury. Tapestries hung from the buildings
and rich carpets were laid down the steps of the cathedral.
Everything that Milan had to show was on exhibition&mdash;even
a crocodile.</p>
<p>But the most impressive sight of all was the unveiling
<span class="pb" id="Page_65">65</span>
of Leonardo&rsquo;s colossal statue. It rose in majesty against
the red walls of the castle. The name of Leonardo da
Vinci was suddenly on everyone&rsquo;s lips. As the word of
his artistic achievement spread from city to city, messages
of praise came pouring in. And, for a while the
years of frustration and failure to gain recognition
melted away. Leonardo at forty-one had at last achieved
some success.</p>
<p>Now there was a breathing spell, and Leonardo returned
to some of his own projects. For a long time he
had continued his observations of his two favorite elements&mdash;air
and water. To him they were related in their
movements. The birds flying in the currents of air and
the fish swimming in the flow of water seemed very
similar to him. He had already designed various instruments
to tell him about the direction of wind and its
velocity, and he had also commenced to analyze the
wing structure of birds and bats. To soar through the
air like a bird was an ancient dream of man, yet for
Leonardo it had become a passion. Ceaselessly, he
sketched the flights of birds, the flutterings of butterflies
and analyzed their flying patterns.</p>
<p>But to Leonardo, understanding the <i>dynamics</i>, or
motion, of air was the most important thing. He built
an <i>anemoscope</i>, an instrument like a weather-vane for
telling the direction of the wind; and, he also constructed
several types of <i>anemometers</i> for measuring the
velocity or force of the wind. One of these latter consisted
of a thin rectangle of metal hanging straight
down in front of an upward-curving wooden arc. This
arc was marked off in units of measurement. When the
wind blew, it pushed the thin rectangle up the arc; thus,
by noting at which gradation it stopped, Leonardo could
tell the velocity.</p>
<p>In addition, Leonardo at this time constructed a device
<span class="pb" id="Page_66">66</span>
which has been compared to the modern instrument
used for testing the weight-carrying capacity of
airplane wings. He fashioned a wing resembling a bird&rsquo;s
wing and attached it to a lever so that it would be possible
to lower the wing by pushing rapidly down on the
lever. This wing in turn was mounted on a plank that
was in weight equal to that of a human being. He then
calculated that two wings of this kind would have to be
about twelve meters wide and twelve meters long to
raise a man and his machine together. Another device
resembling those found in airplanes today that Leonardo
constructed was an inclination gauge. He made this by
suspending a heavy ball on a cord within a glass bell.
This ball was then supposed to guide the flyer by telling
him whether he was flying level, diagonally, up, or
down.</p>

a &ldquo;flyer&rdquo; whether or not he was flying level or tipped.</i></p>
</div>
<p>To Leonardo, water was also a phenomenon that
from his youth never failed to excite his curiosity. The
use of water power to run machines, to irrigate fields
and to carry boats inland was a subject that he never
ceased investigating. Out of his experiments at this time
he constructed a device for raising water to high levels.
It was based on the geometric spiral of Archimedes. He
took a piece of gut, inflated it, and let it dry. Then,
covering it with a coat of wax to make it waterproof,
he wound it around a thin staff in a spiral. He put one
end in a stream and attached it by gears to a cogged
water wheel; this set the long screw to turning, and he
was able to raise water from a low level to any height he
desired. With a multiple system of these screws he could
raise water in continuous circulation to the reservoirs on
the highest towers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<p class="tb">In the year 1494, King Charles VIII of France
crossed the Alps at the head of an army of twenty-five
thousand men. Now Ludovico, by a series of diplomatic
maneuvers, had allied himself with Charles and had, by
secret negotiation, actually invited the invasion. By such
an alliance he hoped to use Charles&rsquo; army to overcome
the forces of the Pope which stood in the path of Ludovico&rsquo;s
ambition to become the most powerful ruler in
Italy. Outwardly Charles was asserting his rights to the
Kingdom of Naples, but inwardly he dreamt of leading
a crusade against the infidels in the Holy Land. At the
same time young Gian Galeazzo Sforza, Duke of Milan,
was dying. Ludovico desired this title for himself; however,
until Galeazzo was out of the way, he could not
have it. There were ugly rumors that young Sforza had
been poisoned. Moreover, in 1494, the Medicis&mdash;another
powerful obstacle&mdash;were expelled from Florence, and
a republic was established.</p>
<p>Soon young Gian Galeazzo died, leaving a son, Francesco.
This son was the rightful heir to the Dukedom of
Milan but Ludovico usurped the boy&rsquo;s claim and declared
himself Duke of Milan. Now Ludovico was in a
position to await the impending battle between Charles
and the Pope.</p>
<p>With such military and political ambitions in mind,
Duke Ludovico now assigned Leonardo the task of reviewing
Milan&rsquo;s defenses. Again Leonardo submitted to
Ludovico his plans for strengthening fortresses and designs
for new ones. The great architect Bramante was
also assigned the task of seeing to the city&rsquo;s defenses,
and for some time the two brilliant men worked together.</p>
<p>Then, in the spring of 1494, Leonardo was sent to
<span class="pb" id="Page_69">69</span>
Vigevano where Ludovico&rsquo;s young wife was staying.
This town was also the birthplace of Ludovico, and
Leonardo was given the job of designing and building a
small summer house and garden there for Beatrice. In
addition, Leonardo built a kind of &ldquo;air conditioner&rdquo; for
her bedroom. It consisted of a large waterwheel that
cooled the air circulated into her room. Although this
ancient device had long been known to the Greeks and
Romans, Leonardo was the one who succeeded in perfecting
it.</p>
<p>During this time Leonardo&rsquo;s highly original mind was
also at work on other devices. One of these was an
<i>odometer</i>, an instrument for measuring the distance
traversed by a vehicle. Dials, turned by a system of gears
attached to the wheel of a wheelbarrow, measured the
distance traveled as the barrow was pushed along the
ground. In addition, Leonardo conceived a kind of
odometer to be used at sea; this consisted essentially of
a spinner that was towed by a ship which registered its
speed. Leonardo even invented an automatic spit operated
by metal vanes mounted in the chimney that revolved
with the pressure of the hot air rising from the
fire&mdash;and a pair of large floating shoes for walking on
water!</p>
<p>In the meantime, Charles VIII of France had marched
through Rome and entered Naples. The conquest was
without opposition. Charles was then crowned King of
Naples and all Italy was at his feet. Yet his triumph was
a short one. Ludovico, having used the king to get rid
of his enemies, now plotted against the king himself. He
formed an alliance with the Pope, Venice, Spain, and
the German emperor. Charles, faced with this league,
hastily beat a retreat to France. Fighting his way to the
border, he there signed a peace treaty. Thus Ludovico
had swept Italy clean of all opposition and was now the
<span class="pb" id="Page_70">70</span>
most powerful prince in the land.</p>
<p>Yet Ludovico was quick to realize that his position
could only be held by force and he set about strengthening
himself and his allies. To provide for more cannons,
a hundred and fifty thousand tons of bronze were sent
to manufacturing works in Ferrara. This, however, included
the very bronze Leonardo needed for the casting
of his equestrian statue, and this is why the statue was
never cast. Years of Leonardo&rsquo;s work now seemed to
vanish overnight. Ludovico also needed large sums of
money to secure friends in high places and Leonardo&rsquo;s
own payments were suddenly dropped. Forced again to
worry about paying for his daily bread and for his household
and apprentices, he wrote letters to Ludovico complaining
of his lack of funds and asking for money that
was owed him for work done. He looked about for
other commissions, but none were available. Moreover,
because he was still court painter to Ludovico, he was
ordered to paint the decorations of some rooms in the
castle. But this was more than Leonardo could take&mdash;he
walked off the job without finishing it.</p>
<p>Despite all of these misfortunes, Leonardo continued
struggling with the problems of flight. He kept working
out the proportions of wing span to the weight of
the load. Indeed, he had already started designs for a
flying machine. He had chosen a room which was the
highest in one of the towers of the castle and which had
access to a roof. Leonardo&rsquo;s plans for a flying machine
were a secret, and, with the exception of an assistant, no
one knew about them. He made sure that he could not
be seen by the workmen on the dome of the cathedral
and proceeded to block off his room with beams which
<span class="pb" id="Page_71">71</span>
he planned to use as supports for his model.</p>
<p>He had thought at first that any attempted flight
should take place over water in order to cushion a possible
crash&mdash;but as his plans progressed he designed a
parachute. It was a pyramid-shaped &ldquo;tent of linen&rdquo;
twenty-four feet broad and twenty-four feet high, and
it is believed to have been successfully tried out from a
tower especially constructed for that purpose.</p>
<p>Since Leonardo was no longer working for Ludovico,
he lived more simply than ever. He made regular lists
of his expenses down to the last penny. His habits were
frugal although he always kept himself neat. His meals
were spare; he drank a little wine at meals and never ate
meat. To his pupils and apprentices, he recommended
regular habits such as not sleeping during midday, eating
only when hungry and chewing well, exercising
moderately, and sleeping well covered.</p>
<p>Yet, even though Leonardo lived cheaply, he was now
greatly in need of money. Swallowing his pride, he
wrote to Ludovico, placing himself at the duke&rsquo;s service
once again. His absence from court, he said, had been
necessary so that he could earn a living. In this and other
ways, Leonardo attempted to heal the break between
them.</p>
<p>It turned out that Ludovico was glad to have Leonardo
<span class="pb" id="Page_72">72</span>
back. Perhaps mindful of the fame that the model
of the equestrian monument had brought the house of
Sforza, he now commissioned Leonardo to paint a picture.
The Dominican monastery of Santa Maria delle
Grazie was the nearest church to the Sforza castle and
a favorite retreat of Ludovico. Here he used to walk in
the quiet garden while the white-robed monks silently
went about their chores. In gratitude for the peace he
found there, Ludovico had had the refectory rebuilt
and on the back wall, a crucifixion scene had been
painted by Montorfano, a Lombard. But the front wall
was given to Leonardo. On this Leonardo decided to
paint a picture of the Last Supper&mdash;the painting that
has since become one of the best known in the world.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>

<br /><i>The French</i></h2>
<div class="img">

</div>
<p>The noonday sun was baking the deserted streets of
<span class="pb" id="Page_74">74</span>
Milan as Leonardo hurried across the drawbridge of the
castle. The guard dozing in the entrance arch started
to his feet, but when he saw who it was he sat down
again, muttering about a madman. Taking the shortest
way, Leonardo arrived at the monastery gate and pulled
on the bellcord. When the gate opened Leonardo
brushed past the startled monk and made directly for
the scaffolding in the refectory. He looked at his almost
completed painting for a moment, took a brush and
mixed a color swiftly on the large palette. Then he
climbed the scaffolding and very quickly applied three
or four strokes. With this he sighed and smiled. Then,
just as abruptly, he put away his brushes and, without a
backward glance, he left, making his way back to the
castle in the hot sun.</p>
<p>For three years, Leonardo had been working this way
on the &ldquo;Last Supper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sometimes he would work from dawn to dusk forgetting
to eat; other times, he would stay away for days
and then run back just to add a touch. Once he arrived
and, with his arms folded across his chest, he stood in
front of it for two hours just studying what he had done.</p>
<p>Now, in 1498, the painting was nearing completion
and the only faces still left blank were those of Christ
and Judas. Leonardo had drawn hundreds of sketches,
taking his models wherever he found them&mdash;once he
sketched a man just for his hands. Now that his name
had become well known he always had an audience while
he worked. His pupils, the monks, visiting nobility,
church officials, and frequently Ludovico himself
watched him as he painted the &ldquo;Last Supper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Leonardo, as usual, was involved in many different
<span class="pb" id="Page_75">75</span>
tasks. He was supervising the installation of a hydraulic
pump over seventy feet high beside a stream
which would use the power of the stream itself to pump
water into the castle. Mindful, too, of the uncertainty
of court patronage, he was designing commercial machinery,
hoping thereby to secure an income outside the
court. Among the most notable of these were an olive
press, an automatic file-cutter, a hydraulic saw, and a
needle sharpener. This latter was a forerunner of modern
sharpeners with their mass-production methods.
With it, Leonardo dreamt of sharpening four hundred
needles at a time, or forty thousand an hour so that in
twelve hours one person could sharpen four hundred and
eighty thousand needles! The needles were arranged successively
on a moving belt of leather and brought against
a rotating grindstone. This grindstone was set in such
a way that the needles were sharpened into curvilinear
points rather than the usual triangular points.</p>
<p>In his travels to Vigevano and other parts of the
countryside around Milan, Leonardo had studied flour
mills. He had talked with the workmen, asked the prices
of grain, and noted the time that it took to do the milling.
Then he made calculations on ways to cut down
the time, and, in fact, redesigned the entire mill. He
mounted twelve cylindrical millstones in rows of four
on one side of a canal and another twelve on the other
side. In the canal were hydraulic wheels or paddlewheels.
Each wheel was attached to a rod that ran underneath
four millstones. Geared to the one rod were four grinding
levers to the stones above. In this way it was possible
to have twenty-four millstones operating at the same
time.</p>
<p>But most fascinating to Leonardo now was the construction
<span class="pb" id="Page_76">76</span>
of his flying machine. His first models involved
the principle of an air-screw mounted on a platform on
which a man stood. But where would the necessary
power come from to lift his machine from the ground?
At first he thought of operating his air-screw by means
of a steel spring coiled around a drum, but this he apparently
abandoned. Later, however, Leonardo did design
another model on this principle which has been called
the forerunner of the modern helicopter. It was to be
operated by four men standing on a platform. Each man
would hold a bar which wound a spring-driven mechanism,
much as in a modern clockworks. The air-screw
was a broad blade spiraling about a vertical shaft&mdash;the
ancestor of the modern propeller.</p>
<p>The model that Leonardo wanted to construct now,
however, was of a different principle. Instead of an air-screw
he substituted a pair of wings fashioned after those
of the birds. There was still a platform on which the flyer
stood and two springs were still the essential &ldquo;motor&rdquo; to
raise and lower the wings. But as Leonardo worked on
his apparatus he began to realize that it would be too
much at the mercy of a sudden gust of wind or a violent
updraft. It was necessary to return to his study of the
air and its currents.</p>
<p>With all of this activity in mechanical devices Leonardo
had reawakened his interest in mathematics. During
this time he was introduced to a man at Ludovico&rsquo;s
court who became his friend and collaborator. He was
a Franciscan monk named Fra Luca Pacioli who had
been appointed a professor of mathematics by Ludovico.
He, too, came from Florence, and in 1496, when he met
Leonardo, he was forty-six years old and the author of
<i>Summa di Arithmetica</i>, the first printed scientific work
of his time. Pacioli was now at work on a book of geometry
to be entitled <i>De Divina Proportione</i> and he enlisted
Leonardo&rsquo;s aid in drawing the plates for his book. As
Leonardo had already made a study of human proportions,
the association with Pacioli was of benefit to them
both. Among Leonardo&rsquo;s best known drawings of human
proportion is a beautifully rendered figure-study of a
standing man with his arms at his sides and then outstretched,
his legs together and then apart, inscribed
within a square and a circle. It was made to illustrate a
passage from Vitruvius on the proportions of a human
figure and demonstrated, among other things, &ldquo;the span
<span class="pb" id="Page_77">77</span>
of a man&rsquo;s outstretched arms is equal to his height.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Moreover, Leonardo found with Pacioli confirmation
of many of his own observations and experiments and
in turn Pacioli gave to Leonardo a confidence in his own
methods. Pacioli also helped Leonardo with his arithmetic,
a subject that Leonardo had neglected in his impatience
to study geometry. The association also helped
to free him further from the cobwebs of medieval beliefs.
For Pacioli, the friendship with Leonardo was a revelation.
Although Pacioli was a learned mathematician,
Leonardo demonstrated to him that the application of
his science encompassed <i>all</i> sciences&mdash;even art&mdash;for
Leonardo later wrote, &ldquo;Let no one read me who is not
a mathematician....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Legend relates that Leonardo became so absorbed in
his studies that the prior of the monastery complained to
Ludovico that the &ldquo;Last Supper,&rdquo; although nearly completed,
still lacked the faces of Christ and Judas. Ludovico
summoned Leonardo to court and laid the complaint
before him. Leonardo, however, was quick to
reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The good prior is an esteemed man, your Grace, but
he is a monk and not a painter. Little does he know that
I spend at least two hours a day on my painting.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
<p>&ldquo;But Master, he says he never sees you there, so how
do you explain these two hours a day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excellency, the figure of Judas must be of incomparable
evil. Every day I search for this face in the
criminal quarter, and every day I fail to find the evil
that I am looking for. If I cannot find this man, however,
I can use the head of the prior&mdash;it would do admirably,
but I have hesitated for fear of hurting his feelings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ludovico slapped his knees and roared with laughter.
There were no more complaints.</p>
<p>Finally, in 1498, the scaffolding was removed from
the painting and Leonardo&rsquo;s masterpiece was revealed.
The twelve apostles grouped at the table are shown each
responding in his own way to the words of Christ,
&ldquo;One of you shall betray me.&rdquo; Again hundreds flocked
to see this latest marvel of Leonardo&rsquo;s. Its striking influence
was felt by generations of painters. Even now, more
than four hundred and fifty years later, the world still
comes to stand before the genius of Leonardo da Vinci
in the refectory of Santa Maria delle Grazie.</p>
<p class="tb">The clouds of war were gathering again over Italy. In
April of 1498, Charles VIII of France died and his successor
was Louis of Orleans, who became Louis XII. The
new King of France laid claim to the Dukedom of Milan,
and Ludovico again tried to form an alliance against
him. But the years of juggling enemy against enemy and
friend against friend were now coming to an end. No one
trusted Il Moro any more, and suddenly he realized that
he was to be alone in this new fight. After nearly twenty
years of power sustained by powerful alliances, Ludovico
was forced to turn to his own people of Lombardy.
Frantically he tried to correct the injustices of years.
The people had been cruelly taxed to support the extravagances
of the Sforza court, and, in addition, they had
been badly treated by petty government officials. Ludovico
now sought to repay the past miseries of his people
and to rally them to his support. In such a spirit he
remembered his court painter, Leonardo da Vinci, and
gave him a vineyard and considerable piece of land not
<span class="pb" id="Page_79">79</span>
far from the Porta Vercellina.</p>
<p>Now, for the first time in his life, Leonardo knew
financial security. With the income from the vineyard,
and in the peace of his estate, he was left free to follow
his own researches. He took no notice that his &ldquo;peace&rdquo;
was surrounded by the threat of war. Indeed, he remained
aloof from politics and court intrigues as much as
was possible for a man living in the midst of such chaotic
times.</p>
<p>Leonardo now had the opportunity to follow up an
early interest&mdash;the study of plants. He made many
beautiful drawings; no plant was too small to catch
his eye. His notes on botany began to grow. With his
genius for observation and analysis of nature, Leonardo
made some extraordinary discoveries of botanical laws
entirely unknown before his time. He wrote of the
phenomenon of <i>heliotropism</i>, or the movement of plants
toward or away from the sunlight. In addition, he
described the phenomenon known as <i>geotropism</i>, or the
growth of plants according to gravitational law, as for
example, roots growing downward and shoots growing
upward. He also defined the laws of phyllotaxis, which
describe the system or order of leaf arrangement on a
plant&rsquo;s stem. That is, leaves are arranged spirally around
a stem so that the third leaf above grows out over the
third leaf below on one type of plant; or, on another
type, the two third leaves are over the two third leaves
below. The same natural laws apply to the branches of
plants as well; they occur so that every leaf and branch
can receive sufficient air and light. Amazingly enough,
these laws, which Leonardo described so completely,
<span class="pb" id="Page_80">80</span>
were not rediscovered until almost two centuries later!</p>
<p>Leonardo went even further in his botanical studies.
He experimented with gourds, planting them in various
aqueous solutions; this anticipated modern methods of
growing plants in chemicals. He also tested the actions
of arsenic and mercury poisons in plants. He reproduced
the shape and form of leaves by pressing them on paper
coated with lampblack, a method that was not used again
until the nineteenth century. Carefully noted, too, in his
writings was the rising of sap from the roots to the
branches by capillary action; this, too, was not rediscovered
until much later&mdash;in the eighteenth century. Leonardo
also extracted oils and essences from flowers and
studied the influences of altitude on the development of
vegetation. Indeed Leonardo&rsquo;s very approaches to a systematic
classification of plants were the forerunners of
modern methods of classifying.</p>
<p>In the seclusion of his own home, as he continued his
<span class="pb" id="Page_81">81</span>
studies of geometry with Pacioli, Leonardo again turned
to his observations of the heavens. On the roof of his
house he had set up a small observatory for watching the
sky at night. Often he looked at the stars through a pinhole
in a sheet of paper. Leonardo did this to stop the
&ldquo;twinkling&rdquo; of the stars which he recognized as an
optical illusion. Moreover, by looking at the stars in this
manner, he noticed that some were larger than others,
and imagined to himself how our own earth might look
from them. Would we not be but another &ldquo;star&rdquo; in a vast
collection of stars? And if that were true&mdash;how could the
earth be the center of the universe? By the same imaginary
reasoning, he speculated on how we must look to
someone on the moon. Realizing that the moonlight on
earth faintly illuminates the dark side of the earth, he
reasoned that then there must be an &ldquo;earthlight&rdquo; doing
the same on the moon. Thus he was the first to explain
the dim reflected light on the dark side of the moon.
Moreover, Leonardo is known to have looked at the
moon through a convex lens, and perhaps even a form of
telescope. Indeed, he had built telescopic-type tubes with
lenses in them and had written directions for their use.
It seems certain that at about this time Leonardo became
convinced of the heliocentric theory, the theory that
states the sun is the center of our universe. On a sheet of
mathematical notes Leonardo wrote in large letters, &ldquo;the
sun does not move.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During this time he continued to seek out books on
astronomy. Leonardo was familiar with Aristotle&rsquo;s
<i>Meteorology</i>, Archimedes&rsquo; <i>On the Center of Gravity</i>,
and with <i>Problems in Aristotle&rsquo;s Books of the Sky and
the World</i>, a work by Albert of Saxony. This last book
Leonardo had to read with the help of a Latin dictionary,
because his Latin was not good. He had already read
Plutarch, who had defined the moon as a solid. Plutarch
had written further that the &ldquo;spots&rdquo; on the moon were
the result of shadows cast by irregularities on its surface.
This theory, that was apparently abandoned during the
Middle Ages, supported the conclusions that Leonardo
had reached by his own observations. But he still struggled
against a mistaken idea of his own. For a long while
he maintained that there were seas and waters upon
the moon which accounted for the sunlight being reflected
<span class="pb" id="Page_82">82</span>
so brilliantly.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in July of 1499, the French army had
reached Lombardy. Ludovico was now in a state of desperation.
He tried to appeal to the people of Milan, explaining
that their heavy taxes had been due to the constant
threats from abroad. But, however hard he tried to
arouse their sense of loyalty to him, the public of Milan
turned a deaf ear. They had not forgotten how Ludovico
had allied himself with Charles VIII&mdash;a foreign king!
Ludovico now had to put his trust in his army commander,
Galeazzo da Sanseverino, despite warnings that
this was a man of doubtful loyalty. Moreover, to make
matters worse, Louis XII had succeeded in forming an
alliance against Ludovico; and, among his allies was a
powerful cardinal, son of Pope Alexander VI&mdash;the notorious
Cesare Borgia.</p>
<p>From a note on a page of designs for supplying and
heating a bath we know that Leonardo continued his
quiet life, only vaguely disturbed by the political upheaval
taking place around him. His note reads, &ldquo;On the
first day of August 1499 I wrote here of movement and
weight.&rdquo; He had made many experiments and calculations
concerning the movement and weight of objects.
He had drawn, for example, the flight of an arrow to
describe motion through air and although he wrote no
specific formula, he marked the three stages of its trajectory&mdash;the
initial push, the slowing and the steeper
downward path as the arrow&rsquo;s momentum was overcome
by the resistance of the air. He also defined the law of
movement on an inclined plane and he arrived at the
root principle of Newton&rsquo;s law of gravitation when he
wrote, &ldquo;every weight tends to fall toward the center by
<span class="pb" id="Page_83">83</span>
the shortest way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A diagram of this period is probably the first scientific
graph. Leonardo had experimented with two balls
dropped from a height. First he dropped them together
and then one after the other. In attempting to solve the
mathematical problems presented by these falling bodies
he drew a graph of vertical and horizontal lines. The
times it took for the balls to fall were marked on the
horizontal lines and the distances on the vertical lines&mdash;thus,
he could trace their relationship.</p>
<p>But this peaceful time of productive work was running
out for Leonardo. Ludovico&rsquo;s commander, Galeazzo,
had yielded the fortress of Alessandria to the
French at the first battle. Ludovico himself had sent his
sons and his treasure to his brother, Cardinal Ascanio,
in Germany. When he saw that his cause was lost, he
turned the Sforza castle over to Bernardino da Corte, a
trusted commander, making certain that it was fully
supplied with arms and food. Then in sorrow, Ludovico
Sforza, Duke of Milan, left his city for the last time as
ruler of Lombardy. The gates of Milan were opened to
the French in October of 1499, and Bernardino da
Corte surrendered the Sforza castle.</p>
<p>French soldiers now occupied Milan as conquerors
<span class="pb" id="Page_84">84</span>
and the people of the city were in a state of confusion.
Those who could made their peace with the French; but
others, who had been supporters of Ludovico, fled to
avoid arrest. Leonardo, who would be suspect to the
French, packed up his few possessions&mdash;although he did
manage to retain his estate&mdash;and left, together with
Pacioli and an apprentice, for Mantua.</p>

</div>
<p>Leonardo, Pacioli, and Salai, the apprentice, arrived in
Mantua in February of the year 1500. They were given
refuge in the castle of Isabella d&rsquo;Este, who was the sister
of Beatrice, and the wife of Francesco Gonzaga, governor
of Mantua. Isabella was one of the eminent women
of her time and attracted to her court the intellectual
life of Italy. In Leonardo she recognized the man of
genius; indeed, she treated him as an equal, putting her
castle at his disposal. She persuaded him to paint her
<span class="pb" id="Page_87">87</span>
portrait and Leonardo commenced a preparatory drawing.</p>
<p>In the evenings at the castle there were discussions and
music and here Leonardo again met his pupil and companion
on the trip from Florence so many years ago&mdash;Atalante
Migliorotti who had left Milan in 1490 to
assume the post of court musician to Isabella.</p>
<p>Although Leonardo had found a haven of peace in the
political storm that raged about the city state of Mantua,
he and Pacioli took to the road again for reasons unknown.
Isabella d&rsquo;Este, who still wanted Leonardo at
her court, sent many a letter and messenger in the following
years to bring Leonardo back&mdash;first to finish the
portrait and then, when that failed, to sell to her any
picture that Leonardo wished to send. Strangely enough,
however, Leonardo seems to have turned his back upon
the one sympathetic person he had met in a world of
indifference.</p>
<p class="tb">The first, warm breezes of spring were blowing over
the lagoons of Venice when Leonardo and Pacioli
stepped ashore on the Piazzetta, or Little Square of San
Marco. But the beauty of this jewel-like city rising from
the sea was momentarily ignored by the two travelers
for an angry, frightened crowd had gathered about the
Doge&rsquo;s palace on the Piazzetta.</p>
<p>The people of Venice were fearful because their fleet
<span class="pb" id="Page_88">88</span>
had just suffered a crushing defeat by the Turks. This
meant that their power at sea, once supreme, was now no
more. Year by year, moreover, their possessions in the
east had been slowly whittled away, and now the city
itself was threatened by invasion. At this same time, the
Venetian ambassador, Manenti, hoping to make peace
with the Turks, had been rudely rejected by them. Panic
soon swept the city and rumors of the bloodthirsty infidel
passed from person to person like the rush of an
ugly wind. Barricades were put up and windows were
barred. In this charged atmosphere, Leonardo and
Pacioli sought out their lodgings.</p>
<p>Soon after Leonardo&rsquo;s arrival here&mdash;either because
his reputation had preceded him or, more likely, because
of Fra Luca Pacioli&rsquo;s recommendations&mdash;he became
directly involved with the defenses of Venice. Immediately
he was sent on an inspection trip of the city&rsquo;s
existing defenses, especially those inland from where an
invasion would probably come. When he had seen
them, he recommended a system of defenses along the
Isonzo river near the present border of Yugoslavia, using
the river itself to the disadvantage of the enemy. He
also made suggestions for the improvement of forts, and
even drew up plans for a completely new type&mdash;a circular
fort. This consisted of a central, circular fort surrounded
by two belts of fortresses each separated by a
moat. In the outside moat were four semicircular outposts.
Communication was by underground galleries.
The total absence of superstructure and projecting balconies
was a new idea for the times. Another new defense
idea was to station in the moat itself a low, thick
tower almost completely submerged, defended by a thin
opening near the waterline. It was reached from the
main fort by an underground passage and the gunsmoke
was removed by vents. According to Leonardo no enemy
could conceal himself in any part of the defenses
and not be seen from such an outpost.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<p>Leonardo&rsquo;s most unusual scheme for defending Venice,
however, was his idea of approaching an enemy
fleet under the water and then putting holes in the hulls
of their ships. Actually, the idea of diving was not a
new one. Aristotle had written of diving and diving
bells, and certainly the stories of pearl fishers in the
Orient were well known in the Renaissance. But Leonardo
designed a diver&rsquo;s suit closely resembling those
used today. This consisted of a complete suit of leather
with helmet and eyepieces; it was made airtight by
spirals of steel at the joints. He then added a bladder for
holding air which fastened inside the suit at the diver&rsquo;s
chest. It is possible that Leonardo also invented an air
chamber that could be used by the diver while under
water&mdash;but he was very secretive about this invention
for fear of how men might abuse such a discovery. He
wrote, &ldquo;... and this I do not publish or divulge, on
account of the evil nature of man, who would practice
assassinations at the bottom of the seas....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leonardo felt the same way about a &ldquo;submarine&rdquo; that
he presented to the Councilors and Tribunal of Venice.
This resembled a turtle&rsquo;s shell with a raised bump on the
center which was the &ldquo;periscope.&rdquo; When submerged
the water probably rose to an area just around the
&ldquo;periscope,&rdquo; but, again, the information about its air-supply
is missing and the only reference to it is a reminder
to close the &ldquo;l&mdash;.&rdquo; In addition, he invented a
system of screws mounted in tongs with the borer in
the middle for putting holes in the bottoms of enemy
ships, and at the same time he thought of a defense
against such an attack by designing the defending vessels
with double hulls.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>
<p>Among Leonardo&rsquo;s other maritime devices were designs
for boats that could dredge canals, harbors, and
lagoons. What was the result of all these plans? We do
not know. Whether any one of them was used against
the Turks is a mystery.</p>
<p>At any rate, Leonardo and Pacioli left Venice that
same spring and arrived in Florence in April of 1500.
One of the purposes of Leonardo&rsquo;s journey was to visit
his father who was now living on Via Ghibellina with
his fourth wife. Leonardo was now forty-eight. Still
tall and straight with the strength of his youth, his face
prematurely aged and his hair thinning back from his
high forehead, Leonardo was more than ever an outstanding
looking man. He still scorned fashionable
clothes and dressed according to his own comfort which
made him even more noticeable among the crowd. His
deep-set eyes with their direct and penetrating glance,
framed by his full, reddish beard, never missed a thing,
although he now wore spectacles at his work.</p>
<p>Now that he was back in Florence, Leonardo needed
lodgings and a job. He had banked his small savings,
and he did not want to touch that. His father&rsquo;s house
with the five children of his present wife plus the sons
from his previous marriages was too full to accommodate
Leonardo. Moreover, the relationship between
Piero and Leonardo was polite but distant, as Piero
preferred the children of his later marriages.</p>
<p>Luckily, the place to live and the commission Leonardo
<span class="pb" id="Page_91">91</span>
needed presented themselves at the same time.
The Church of the Annunciation of the Servite Order
of Monks needed an altarpiece, and, as Leonardo&rsquo;s fame
was great, they offered him and his apprentice quarters
in the monastery. Here, in the solitude of a monastic
cell, Leonardo was able to return to his own researches.
His long association with Fra Luca Pacioli continued as
they worked together on Pacioli&rsquo;s edition of Euclid&rsquo;s
<i>Elements</i>. At the same time, with his absorption in
geometry, Leonardo commenced his studies of the transformation
of solids; that is, changing the shape of something
to another shape without diminishing or increasing
its substance.</p>
<p>In his preoccupation with geometry, Leonardo had
apparently done little about the commission which the
Servite monks had given him. He finally yielded to their
complaints, however, and commenced to draw the preliminary
study for the subject, which was &ldquo;St. Anne
with the Virgin and Child.&rdquo; Again his knowledge of
geometry is most apparent in the finely constructed
composition, every gesture of which is as plotted as a
geometric exercise. In April of 1501, the drawing was
finished; it caused an immediate sensation throughout
Florence. For two days the public was allowed to pass
in front of it.</p>
<p>But now a change was taking place in Leonardo. He
was no longer content with simply painting. His highly
original researches for pictures had slowly grown to the
point where the research was more important than
painting. In a sense the scientist had taken the brush
from the artist. In two letters from Isabella d&rsquo;Este&rsquo;s
emissary in Florence we learn, &ldquo;He is entirely wrapped
up in geometry and has no patience for painting.&rdquo; This
excerpt from a letter dated April 8, 1501, was followed
six days later by another which said in part, &ldquo;In brief,
his mathematical experiments have made painting so distasteful
to him that he cannot even bear to take up a
<span class="pb" id="Page_92">92</span>
brush.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">A few months after the completion of the St. Anne
drawing, Leonardo received a letter signed by Cesare
Borgia, Duke of Valentinois. Leonardo frowned and
thought back to his last days in Milan. When King
Louis XII of France had entered the city, he had summoned
the painter of the &ldquo;Last Supper&rdquo; to an audience.
The king had been generous in his praise and had tried
to persuade Leonardo to remain. At that same audience
had also been Cesare Borgia, an ally of the French. Leonardo
remembered the man now&mdash;the dark hair and
eyes, the black, arched eyebrows, and the face marked
by some old disease. He was a powerful-chested, thin-hipped
man who had originally been made a cardinal by
his father, Pope Alexander VI. But the attractions of
secular power soon persuaded him to abandon this title.
With the enthusiastic help of his father, Borgia had
fought, murdered, and deceived his way to a formidable
position of authority in these last years. Leonardo, in
the seclusion of the monastery, had lately heard that
Borgia&rsquo;s army had even been at the gates of Florence.</p>
<p>The letter addressed to Leonardo was an offer to assume
the post of Architect and Military Engineer to
His Excellency, Cesare Borgia. He thought of Ludovico
Sforza&mdash;defeated and captured at the battle of Novara
just a year ago as he attempted to regain his dukedom.
Now the duke was a prisoner at Loches in Touraine;
Leonardo had written of him, &ldquo;The duke lost his State,
his personal possessions and his liberty, and none of his
enterprises have been completed.&rdquo; And Leonardo also
thought of his equestrian monument still standing in the
castle being used for target practice by the French
archers. Like the duke, nothing of his own had been
completed either. Perhaps this Borgia offer was an opportunity.
<span class="pb" id="Page_93">93</span>
Leonardo decided to accept it.</p>
<p>In May of 1502, after having presented himself to
Cesare Borgia in Rome, Leonardo began his hectic
travels through Tuscany and Umbria. He was to inspect
the fortresses and cities of Cesare&rsquo;s new conquests there,
and to make whatever recommendations he felt necessary
for their improvements. Arriving in Piombino, he
at once set down a project for draining the marshes and
reclaiming the land. Also, while he was here, he spent
hours by the sea watching the waves curl in from the
Adriatic and studying the crash of water over the
beaches. Moving on to Arrezzo, he drew up the first in
a series of remarkable maps for the army of Vitellozzo
which, with the backing of Cesare Borgia, was marching
against Florence. These maps are bird&rsquo;s-eye views of
Tuscany and Umbria, and somewhat resemble modern
aerial photographs. Drawn from Leonardo&rsquo;s own observations,
the green mountains stand, according to their
height, in relief, with the roads winding over them and
down through the valleys. The streams and their tributaries
are in blue and even the villages and cities are
drawn with great exactitude. Indeed Leonardo had
learned his lessons from old Toscanelli well, and he was
one of the first to bring the art of cartography to such
perfection.</p>
<p>In July and August Leonardo was in Urbino and
<span class="pb" id="Page_94">94</span>
Pesaro, and by the 8th of August he had reached Rimini.
Here he strengthened the fortifications and then rode
quickly on to Cesena. Between Cesena, capital of the
Romagna, and Porto Cesanatico, he spent from the middle
of August to September planning a canal between
the two, redesigning government buildings, and drawing
up a new quarter to be built for the city of Cesena.
At this time he constructed an instrument for telling
him the speed of water currents in a stream. It told
him whether the flow was swifter at the surface or at
the bottom or on one side or the other of the stream&rsquo;s
bed.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Florence, alarmed at the growing
power of Cesare Borgia, appealed to Charles d&rsquo;Amboise,
Regent of Milan for France, to come to her aid.
Charles responded in the absence of the French King
and helped to protect Florence. The enemies of Cesare
took advantage of this to form an alliance, and soon
Cesare was being forced back from his newly won
possessions. Cesare himself then hastened to Milan, and
there he suddenly came face to face again with Louis,
the King of France, who was on his way to Naples.
Borgia, who could exert great charm and influence
when he wished, persuaded the king that, all rumors
to the contrary, he, Cesare, was fighting the enemies of
France. Again he won over the French, which greatly
strengthened his position. Then, from Pavia, he issued
a decree placing every facility possible at Leonardo&rsquo;s
disposal. In addition, he instructed all officials to help
Leonardo in every matter, referring to him as &ldquo;our
highly esteemed court architect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While Leonardo was in Porto Cesanatico, a delegation
<span class="pb" id="Page_95">95</span>
from Bayzid II, Sultan of Turkey, paid a visit to
Cesare Borgia. Among other things the delegation was
looking for an engineer to build a bridge between Constantinople
and Pera to replace a temporary wooden
structure. Leonardo designed for them a single-arched
bridge with double ramps at either end (looking very
much like a present-day &ldquo;thruway&rdquo; entrance). He provided
that it should be approximately twelve hundred
feet long, eighty feet wide, and one hundred and forty
feet above the water.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig12">
<img src="images/pg054.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="228" />
<p class="pcap"><i>Da Vinci&rsquo;s proposed bridge from Constantinople (Istanbul)
to Pera. Looking very much like a modern &ldquo;thruway&rdquo;
entrance, it was to have double ramps on both sides.</i></p>
</div>
<p>In his travels through the countryside, Leonardo
could not help but notice how primitive the mills were.
Feeling how strongly the wind blew in from the sea, he
designed a windmill with a roof that turned with the
sails. For the mechanism inside he devised a band brake&mdash;a
semicircle of wood into which the large cogwheel
of the mill was forced. This mill resembles the &ldquo;Dutch&rdquo;
mills of the Netherlands and was among the first of its
type to be brought into existence.</p>
<p>In the fall Leonardo was at Imola. There he created
<span class="pb" id="Page_96">96</span>
another of his beautifully rendered maps. He drew this
with the help of a magnetic compass of his own invention.
It consisted of a board with an arc on it and a
compass needle, and was probably the first magnetic
needle on a horizontal axis. This time the map was of
the city itself, the walls, the castle and the principal
buildings all touched with color and the river winding
through the fields. Drawn in the shape of a circle, it
resembles a view through a telescope from directly
above. In Imola, too, he met Niccol&ograve; Machiavelli, the
famous historian and political scientist, who was an
emissary from the Signoria, the Council which now
governed Florence. These two men became friends and,
later, collaborators in Leonardo&rsquo;s scheme to make the
Arno river navigable to the sea.</p>
<p>At this time Cesare Borgia, having achieved great success
in his military campaigns and confident of his conquests,
decided to return to Rome. With the disbanding
of Borgia&rsquo;s headquarters at Imola, Leonardo&rsquo;s duties
were finished. Together with his new friend Niccol&ograve;
Machiavelli and two other Florentines, he left Imola and
the service of Cesare Borgia to return to Florence.</p>
<p>In January of 1503, a mathematician named Giovanni
Battista Danti attempted a flight in a machine that he
had designed. This flight was part of the entertainment
at a wedding reception in Perugia. Danti climbed into
his apparatus on top of the tower of St. Mary of the
Virgin. It was pushed off into the air, hovered a few
seconds, then began slowly drifting toward the ground.
But suddenly, one of its wings hit a building projection
and it crashed. Danti was carried away with a broken
leg.</p>
<p>The news of the event traveled quickly to Florence.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<p>When Leonardo heard about it, he eagerly questioned
all those who had either seen it or had heard it described
first hand. Danti&rsquo;s attempted flight excited Leonardo
for now he realized that he was no longer alone in his
search. With a sense of urgency he returned to the
problems of flying. He felt now that the solution to
flight might be in the swift gusts of air through the
ravines and the spread wings of the eagle drifting high
in the sky.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<h2 id="c10"><span class="small">10</span>
<br /><i>Shattered Hopes</i></h2>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="49" />
</div>
<p>Before Leonardo could return to the problem of flight,
however, he was again faced with the necessity of supporting
himself and his growing household. The small
fees he received for taking on apprentices hardly covered
the cost of housing and feeding them. Moreover,
the equipment he had to buy for his scientific researches
added further to his strained budget. So, when a servant
from Francesco del Giocondo, a rich Florentine merchant,
presented himself at the gate with the request
that Leonardo accept a commission to paint Francesco&rsquo;s
wife, Leonardo was only too glad to accept. The name
of Francesco&rsquo;s wife was Madonna Lisa, or Mona Lisa
for short. Leonardo painted her portrait on and off for
the next three years. Thus, what started as a minor commission
ended as the one painting&mdash;in addition to the
&ldquo;Last Supper&rdquo;&mdash;that most people today associate with
<span class="pb" id="Page_99">99</span>
the name of Leonardo da Vinci.</p>
<p>Having secured this work, Leonardo turned back to
his studies of birds in flight and the nature of air. The
soaring wings of eagles and hawks and the way they
rode the currents with hardly a dip of their spread wings
guided Leonardo&rsquo;s thinking from pure mechanics to
machines that act more on the principle of the glider.
He proposed to write a treatise on the nature of birds&rsquo;
flight, and, with his usual thoroughness, he began to
weigh, dissect, and reconstruct various types of birds
and their wing structure. He realized that one of the
main difficulties of gliding was maintaining balance, or,
more accurately, maintaining the center of gravity.
From previous observations Leonardo had noted that
man is capable of making the same motions that a bird
does. He had also measured the strength of a man&rsquo;s legs
and had calculated that man has twice the power in his
leg muscles that he needs for standing. Consequently
he began to redesign his machine making use of man&rsquo;s
arms and legs to operate or &ldquo;flap&rdquo; the wings instead of
standing him on a platform.</p>
<p>The first of Leonardo&rsquo;s new designs was a sort of
<span class="pb" id="Page_100">100</span>
harness apparatus strapped across the shoulders of the
flyer who was supposed to be able to keep himself balanced
by moving the lower part of his body. He could
manipulate the flight by handles that were connected
to the flexible, outer parts of the wings. These wings
were designed from the webbed wings of the bat. Surprisingly
enough, this device closely resembled the experimental
gliders used by Otto Lilienthal almost four
centuries later in Germany.</p>
<p>Leonardo was now approaching other solutions to
pure flight when further hostilities interrupted his
work. Florence and Pisa were in bitter rivalry, and their
struggle had assumed the proportions of a major war.
The Florentine army was now practically at the gates
of Pisa. Niccol&ograve; Machiavelli urged the Signoria to enlist
the help of Leonardo da Vinci, who might be able to
think of an immediate plan for destroying Pisa and her
army. Never one to think in terms of an immediate
battle or a temporary success, Leonardo put forth a
daring and sweeping plan that would forever reduce
the power of Pisa. The plan was as simple as it was
monumental&mdash;divert the Arno river from its course into
two canals that would empty into the sea at Leghorn
south of Pisa. In this way, Pisa would lose her water
supply and her opening to the sea.</p>
<p>The plan met with immediate approval and by the
end of July 1503, Leonardo was sent out to survey the
entire course of the river. He was accompanied by Giovanni
&ldquo;the Piper,&rdquo; a man who was frequently employed
on minor engineering projects and who was the
official player of the pipes to the city of Florence.
Giovanni was also the father of Benvenuto Cellini, who
became the most famous goldsmith of the Renaissance.
As they made their way to Pisa, Leonardo made some
more of his extraordinary maps of the area, paying particular
attention to the course of the Arno and its tributaries.
These maps later inspired him to plan a whole
<span class="pb" id="Page_101">101</span>
series showing the main watersheds of Italy.</p>
<p>When he rode into the Florentine camp drawn up
before Pisa, Leonardo designed from his observations
and maps, a dam on the Arno to regulate the course of
the river. This bird&rsquo;s-eye view map is a marvel of exactness.
It shows the flow of the river hitting the dam with
its swirling backwash and overflow. Leonardo&rsquo;s knowledge
of the movement of water was so great and his
craftsmanship in drawing so fine that the water in this
map seems to flow before one&rsquo;s eyes. One of the main
problems in regulating the Arno was its tendency to
continually be shifting its bed by the deposits of new
sediment, and Leonardo realized it would be a long
time before this project could be completed.</p>
<p>When he returned to Florence he presented to the
Signoria, as part of his survey, various machines to
hasten the excavation of the Arno. He had designed a
crane that would assist in the digging out of two different
levels at the same time. He also submitted the results
of his calculations on the saving of muscular energy
by the use of such machines. In addition, Leonardo
proposed to use the water in the canals for irrigation
purposes and had even calculated what the volume and
velocity of a jet of water would be if projected from an
opening in the bottom of the canal wall into an irrigation
ditch. As if this were not enough, he had invented
a practical method of piling as a foundation for the
lock-basins to protect them against the dangers of erosion.</p>
<p>A separate map of this period on the flow of rivers in
<span class="pb" id="Page_102">102</span>
general was intended to relate to his treatise on the
nature of water. In this treatise is the first outline of the
fundamental principles of hydrodynamics, as for example:</p>
<p>The velocity of a current increases with the slope and
decreases with the winding of the riverbed.</p>
<p>The volume of a river is in proportion to the width
of its bed, the slope and the depth of the water being
equal.</p>
<p>The slope and width being equal, the speed of the
current is greatest in the deepest part of the river.</p>
<p>The excavation force increases at the narrowest section
of the river.</p>
<p class="tb">Because of the grumbling of the military commanders
at what they considered a waste of time, Machiavelli
had to intervene with the Signoria before Leonardo was
sent out again with documents of authority to continue
with his plans. He spent well into the fall surveying the
Arno and in October he was back in Florence.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the fighting between Pisa and Florence
had been lessened by two political changes. In August
Pope Alexander VI had died and his son Cesare Borgia
became seriously ill. The Republic of Florence was now
free of its most dangerous enemies&mdash;the Borgias. The
city relaxed in its new security and the hostilities between
Florence and Pisa died down to an uneasy armed
watch.</p>
<p>Leonardo quickly took advantage of the situation to
<span class="pb" id="Page_103">103</span>
present an early dream of his to the Signoria. He again
put forth his idea of a commercial canal to the sea and
made mention of the great advantages there would be
for all the mills, lumber yards, forges and other commercial
interests in utilizing the water power that would
be available from his project. Piero Soderini, the governor
of the city-state of Florence, was impressed and
thought of the glory it would bring to Florence and
himself. He told Leonardo he would present it to the
Signoria.</p>
<p>Leonardo now plunged into a winter of great activity.
Forced to draw from his savings, he had rejoined the
guild of painters in October of 1503, and then applied
for the commission of painting the murals in the council
chamber of the Palace of the Signoria. It had been
planned to decorate this great hall with scenes commemorating
famous Florentine victories, and Leonardo
chose the battle of Anghiari where the soldiers of Florence
defeated the Milanese in 1440. In addition to working
on the &ldquo;Mona Lisa&rdquo; and continuing with the canal
project&mdash;for which he was now designing great suction
pumps to lift rivers from one level to another&mdash;he
turned again to astronomy and geology.</p>
<p>Leonardo, while investigating the course of the upper
Arno, had come across much evidence that the land
there had at one time been completely under water.
Various types of ancient ocean life and vegetation lay
scattered in layers along the ridges of the mountains,
and these Leonardo collected and brought back to his
studio. He wrote, &ldquo;above the plains of Italy where now
birds fly in flocks, fishes were wont to wander in large
shoals.&rdquo; He reread Ptolemy, the ancient Greek geographer
Strabo, and even Sir John Mandeville, an English
author of travel books, in his quest for knowledge of
distant places. He talked to travelers, sailors, and wrote
to friends to send him information about the countries
they had seen or lived in. Strabo, in particular, had set
forth the doctrine that the earth&rsquo;s transformation had
taken place by the forces of volcanoes and water, but
the wisdom of these early men had been obscured by
<span class="pb" id="Page_104">104</span>
the closed minds of the Middle Ages.</p>
<p>Even in his own time of reawakening knowledge&mdash;the
Renaissance&mdash;Leonardo had to contend with the
combined superstition of the Church and the ignorance
of misguided scholars. For example, the Church believed
in the great flood, as described in the Bible, and
the scholars claimed that if what Leonardo said were
true&mdash;that the earth was the result of an evolutionary
process&mdash;there would have been written records. To
this latter Leonardo responded, &ldquo;... sufficient for us
is the testimony of things produced in the salt waters
and now found again in the high mountains far from
the seas.&rdquo; But Leonardo&rsquo;s conception of the evolution
of the earth was mistaken in one respect. He regarded
the earth as organic&mdash;living&mdash;and the flow of water he
believed to be like the flow of blood in man. Indeed,
according to Leonardo, all living creatures were reflections
of a living, breathing earth. It was only when he
again turned his eyes inquiringly toward the moon and
the laws of the universe that he began to realize his
error.</p>
<p>It had been the idea that the earth was the center of
<span class="pb" id="Page_105">105</span>
the universe which supported Leonardo&rsquo;s theory of an
organic earth. Yet after years of observation and study
he abandoned this theory and, with the eye of a man
centuries ahead of his time, he wrote in his notes, &ldquo;The
moon has every month a winter and a summer. And it
has greater colds and greater heats and its equinoxes are
colder than ours.&rdquo; He went further and identified the
elements existing on the moon such as &ldquo;water, air, and
fire,&rdquo; and described them and their functions as being
like those on our own earth. In so doing he recognized
the existence of the moon as a solid in space, reflecting
the light of the sun&mdash;one of many &ldquo;stars&rdquo; in a universe.
With his acceptance of this concept he realized that the
earth could not be organic.</p>
<p class="tb">In May of 1504, the Signoria complained to Leonardo
that there had been no progress on the proposed paintings
for their council chamber, even though he had
already been partially paid for them. Accordingly, he
was forced to sign a document that he must be finished
by February of next year or refund all monies paid him.
As was his custom he had made many preliminary drawings.
Although he was well acquainted with horses he
had again researched their anatomy and actions. Pages
of rearing, frightened horses and men in combat covered
his studio tables. On one of these pages there are
sketches of the heads of a lion, some horses and a man&mdash;all
with fierce expressions on their faces. Here Leonardo
hinted at the comparative anatomy of expression
in man and animal that Darwin was to write about
almost four hundred years later.</p>
<p>But the paintings could wait, for now the Arno River
<span class="pb" id="Page_106">106</span>
was in spring flood. The time had arrived to make the
first attempts at diverting the river into its new course.
Leonardo was again in the field supervising the work.
There had been much opposition to Leonardo&rsquo;s canal
from both the army captains and the Signoria. It was
called a whim and a crazy idea, but Piero Soderini and
Niccol&ograve; Machiavelli were stubborn in their defense of
Leonardo&rsquo;s plan and they overcame all opposition to it.
And indeed, the raising of the sluice gates was successful
and the Arno actually flowed into its new bed. The
tensions in the camp and in the Council of Florence
were eased. The only sad person was Leonardo, for he
had just learned of the death of his father.</p>
<p>Leonardo felt the loss deeply. Outwardly, however,
he only acknowledged the death of his father at a distance.
Not only had Leonardo and his father drifted
apart over the years, Piero left nothing to Leonardo in
his will. His father&rsquo;s other children quarreled among
themselves over what money he did leave. Leonardo&rsquo;s
one friend in the family was Uncle Francesco, who was
still living in Vinci. When he heard of his brother&rsquo;s will,
Francesco made out a will of his own and left everything
to the nephew he loved&mdash;Leonardo.</p>
<p>After having successfully diverted the Arno river, it
was now necessary for Leonardo to return to the painting
commissioned by the Signoria for its council chamber.
But recently, Leonardo had suffered a rebuff in this
work. Originally he had been given the whole room to
do but now the opposite wall had been assigned to another
man&mdash;Michelangelo Buonarroti. Leonardo had
first met the young Michelangelo when he helped to
judge the best location for Michelangelo&rsquo;s monumental
statue of David. The two men were opposites in every
way. Leonardo, fifty-two years old, carefully dressed,
cool and detached, was a man whose every action was
the result of a thoughtful and analytical mind. Michelangelo,
twenty-six years old, his clothes rumpled and
covered with marble dust, was passionate and moody&mdash;an
impulsive youth totally dedicated to art. They did
not like each other, and now Leonardo was forced into
<span class="pb" id="Page_107">107</span>
a rivalry for which he had no heart.</p>
<p>The duel between these two giants of art aroused the
whole of Florence and there was a constant stream of
people watching them at work. Michelangelo was given
a studio in the hospital of Sant&rsquo; Onofrio and Leonardo
was working in the Papal Chamber in Santa Maria
Novella. Among the many people who came to watch
Leonardo was a young man of nineteen. He was already
a pupil of Perugino and the experience of meeting and
learning from Leonardo was to influence him the rest of
his life. His name was Raffaello Sanzio&mdash;one of the
great Renaissance painters of Italy and known to us
by the name of Raphael.</p>
<p>While Leonardo worked at Santa Maria Novella he
had the opportunity of continuing his studies in anatomy.
Dissections at that time were novelties and when
one was performed the doors were thrown open to the
public. Leonardo must have attended the public dissections
at the Church of Santa Croce. Now at Santa Maria
Novella there was a hospital, and here Leonardo was
able to continue his own dissections without interruption.
In a cool room below the hospital where bodies
were kept Leonardo worked late into the night. By the
flickering lights of candles and in the silence of the world
about him he studied, drew, and wrote in his notes of
the wonders of the human body.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">108</div>
<div class="img" id="fig13">

<p class="pcap"><i>In a cool room below the hospital, Leonardo worked late
into the night.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">109</div>
<p>He performed autopsies on people who had died
natural deaths&mdash;a special permission granted to him by
the monks of the church, and among these autopsies are
the first written reports of some of the diseases that are
the causes of death. Arteriosclerosis, or stony growths in
the blood vessels, and pulmonary tuberculosis, a nut-like
growth in the lung, are among the discoveries
Leonardo made in his lonely searches, although he did
not use these medical names for them.</p>
<p>Above all Leonardo was attracted to the function of
the muscles, especially those in the arms and legs. So
faithfully, in fact, did he record the origin and insertion
of all the various muscles that these drawings can be
used as anatomical models today. Moreover, he believed
that a good drawing was worth pages of words describing
human anatomy. The muscles were rendered as cords
so as to better understand their function. He described
this function as one of pulling instead of pushing and he
noted that for every muscle there is an opposing muscle.
When one contracts the other expands. For example,
when you tighten the biceps in your arm you can feel
the looseness of the triceps, the muscle on the opposite
side.</p>
<p class="tb">As the end of the summer of 1504 approached, Leonardo&rsquo;s
dream of the canal from Florence to the sea was
destroyed. The summer had been hot and without rain.
The water in the canal dried up and the Arno river
returned to its original course. All the old arguments
against the plan were revived. The Florentine army
captains rebelled against the job of defending a useless
project. Again Soderini and Machiavelli intervened.
After heated debates in the Council of Eighty, which
had been called into special session, Machiavelli himself
was sent out to oversee the work. It was brought
almost to completion when in late October disaster
struck. The rains that had failed to come in summer fell
from the heavens in great cloudbursts. Storm after storm
swept the valleys. The workmen left and the soldiers
were recalled. The Pisan army rushed in to fill up the
diggings and one final storm washed away the dream
<span class="pb" id="Page_110">110</span>
to nothing but eroded mounds of dirt.</p>
<p>Leonardo buried his disappointment in other work.
When the drawing for the Battle of Anghiari was ready
for transfer to the wall of the council chamber, he had
a special scaffolding made of his own invention which
worked on the principle of a pair of scissors standing
on end, with a long platform on top. As the legs were
spread the scaffolding was lowered and when they
were pinched together it was raised. The wall had been
prepared with a special mixture which he hoped would
bring out the brilliance of his tempera colors. With several
assistants who had been assigned to him by the
Signoria the violence of the Battle of Anghiari was transferred
to the wall and the actual painting was begun.</p>
<p>During the winter months Leonardo would relax from
his work on the huge painting and his dissections to roam
the country around Florence. He visited the slaughterhouses
where the animals were killed and prepared for
market. Here he was able to examine the hearts of animals
just slaughtered and to note that the heart retained
its action until the body was almost cold. He made a
glass model of the aorta (the main artery leading from
the heart) of an ox with which he could experiment on
the flow of the blood. He intended to add to it a glass
tube for one of the semilunar valves of the heart. He
also experimented with a frog, dissecting its brain, heart,
and entrails and noted that it ceased to twitch only when
the spinal cord was severed. In his notes, he wrote, &ldquo;The
frog instantly dies when the spinal cord is pierced; and
previous to this it lived without head, without heart or
any bowels or intestines or skin; and here therefore it
would seem lies the foundation of movement and life.&rdquo;
He was of course searching for the reasons that muscles
<span class="pb" id="Page_111">111</span>
moved and from where the impulses originated.</p>
<p>One of Leonardo&rsquo;s favorite places to visit was Fiesole
where his uncle Allessandro Amadori lived. Uncle Allessandro
was the brother of Leonardo&rsquo;s first stepmother
and, since he had loved her so much, he likewise felt
an affection for Allessandro. At Fiesole, which rises
over Florence in a steep ascent, Leonardo could watch
the birds circling in the air below him.</p>
<p>On these lofty heights, he would unfold his drawings
of flying machines. Leonardo had progressed now to a
point where an actual flight was all that was left. He had
designed a sort of flying boat&mdash;a shell with wings that
moved up and down and he had introduced a tail like
that of a bird. He had noted that the tail of a bird acts
as a rudder, a stabilizer and a brake when landing.</p>
<p>But Leonardo&rsquo;s most recent design was one that was
called an <i>ornithopter</i>. It consisted of a wooden frame,
two huge wings like a bat&rsquo;s, a series of ropes and pulleys
and a windlass, all planned with the lightest of materials.
The flyer, lying prone in the frame, his feet in leather
stirrups connected to the wings by pulleys, would move
his feet up and down to flap the wings while, at the
same time, he operated the windlass with his arms in
order to guide the machine. Soon he hoped to build this
machine and try it out.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">112</div>
<p>Meanwhile, Leonardo returned to his painting in the
council chamber with impatience, for spring was approaching
and the time to finally realize his dream of
flying would be at hand. Aside from an assistant who had
tested the pedals and windlass, no one knew of his plan
to actually put his machine in the air.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig14">

<p class="pcap"><i>The</i> ornithopter, <i>one of Leonardo&rsquo;s designs for a &ldquo;flying
machine.&rdquo; By pumping his feet in the stirrups, the flyer
could flap the device&rsquo;s wings.</i></p>
</div>
<p>Weeks passed and the painting was almost finished.
The huge wall was covered with plunging horses and
embattled soldiers. The colors were brilliant on the
special mixture he had prepared for the wall&mdash;but they
were not drying as they should have. Something was
wrong. To speed the drying process, Leonardo had a
special fire built in the room that directed the heat onto
the painting. Spectators were allowed to watch as the
waves of hot air rose against the wall. Then&mdash;disaster
began slowly with a small trickle of paint from the top!
Before anybody could put out the fire, the great figures
and horses slowly melted down the wall in shiny, sticky
streaks of color. Leonardo fled the room in an agony of
<span class="pb" id="Page_113">113</span>
shame.</p>
<p>With his own friends discouraged, the Signoria hostile,
and the friends of Michelangelo triumphant, Leonardo
went back to Fiesole. He went back with his secret
dream of flight. The world would soon forget the
Battle of Anghiari&mdash;but the conquest of the air, if he
could achieve it, would live forever.</p>
<p>In the spring of 1506, from the slopes of Monte Cecero
near Fiesole, legend tells us that a great bird sailed into
the air and disappeared. No one knows whether Leonardo
actually flew his machine or not but Girolamo
Cardano, the son of a friend of Leonardo, wrote, long
after Leonardo had died, &ldquo;Leonardo da Vinci also attempted
to fly, but he failed. He was a fine painter.&rdquo;
Another dream had been shattered.</p>

<br /><i>The Return to Milan</i></h2>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="49" />
</div>
<p>Leonardo felt his fifty-four years that spring day in
1506. The bitterness of his failures and the frustration
of his dreams added considerably to the weight of his
years. All morning he had wasted in argument with
Soderini and the Signoria. If it had not been for the
letter from Charles d&rsquo;Amboise, Viceroy of the King of
France for Milan, he would have felt like a beggar.
Charles d&rsquo;Amboise had been appointed military governor
of Milan by Louis XII ever since the French had
conquered that city and captured Duke Ludovico
Sforza. But the authority of the letter had finally won
a grudging consent from Soderini. Leonardo looked
about him to see if he had forgotten anything and slowly
climbed onto his horse. He nodded to Salai, his apprentice,
looked back to see if his servant had the pack-horses
ready, and started down the street leading the small
<span class="pb" id="Page_115">115</span>
procession. He was going back to Milan.</p>
<p>Leonardo took out the letter and reread it. The words
were respectful and admiring&mdash;and in French. They
requested the presence of &ldquo;Ma&icirc;tre Leonard de Vinci&rdquo;
at the court of Charles d&rsquo;Amboise, for purposes of painting
and other &ldquo;diverse projects&rdquo; for the King of France.
The letter restored a measure of confidence to Leonardo&rsquo;s
self-respect. Before Leonardo left, Soderini had
made him sign a letter in which Leonardo promised to
return to Florence within three months and to leave
a deposit of one hundred and fifty florins which would
be held against his return. It was signed, notarized and
dated May 30, 1506. Nevertheless, Leonardo had decided
to accept the French envoy&rsquo;s offer; moreover,
he looked forward to the prospect of returning to his
vineyard at Porta Vercellina and the understanding of
a sympathetic patron.</p>
<p>Indeed, Charles d&rsquo;Amboise turned out to be more
than sympathetic. He recognized Leonardo as a great
artist; but even more, he was one of the few patrons
who could appreciate the magnitude of Leonardo&rsquo;s
scientific and mechanical genius. In the court of Charles,
Leonardo once more enjoyed a time of peace and an
assured income. The French Vice-Chancellor of Milan,
Geffroy Carles, who was second in command, was also
a distinguished scholar and a patron of the arts and
natural sciences. With the admiration and support of
these two men and especially with the distant backing of
King Louis XII of France, Leonardo&rsquo;s dismal memories
<span class="pb" id="Page_116">116</span>
of Florence began to fade.</p>
<p>Leonardo&rsquo;s three months&rsquo; allotted absence from Florence,
however, were soon past and a letter arrived from
Soderini demanding either Leonardo&rsquo;s return or a forfeiture
of the one hundred and fifty florins deposit. Now
a tug-of-war developed between the Viceroy of Milan
and the governor of Florence over Leonardo. The Signoria
reminded Charles that Leonardo had his work to
complete, while Charles d&rsquo;Amboise and Geffroy Carles
demanded an extension of time. One month more was
granted. More letters were exchanged until the affair became
so heated that the King of France himself intervened.
In January of 1507 the French King informed
Soderini and the Signoria that Leonardo was &ldquo;not to
move from Milan until our arrival.&rdquo; Since Florence at
this time was under the protection of the French, such
final authority silenced the Signoria. Shortly afterwards
Leonardo discharged his obligation to the Signoria by
relinquishing the one hundred and fifty florins, and he
at last became free from the demands of his native city.</p>
<p>On May 24, 1507 King Louis XII re-entered Milan
with all the splendor and color that France and the
Dukedom of Milan could confer upon their ruler.
Knights in armor and the ladies of the courts followed
the king who rode in flowing white and gold under a
canopy of blue decorated with the lilies of France.</p>
<p>With such pomp and display in Milan, Leonardo was
<span class="pb" id="Page_117">117</span>
soon back at his old occupation of designing pageants
and tournaments. While some of the people from the
days of the Sforzas returned, not many remembered
Duke Ludovico, who was slowly dying in a French
dungeon. Among the people that Leonardo now met,
there appeared Francesco de&rsquo; Melzi, a noble from an old
Milanese family, who entered Leonardo&rsquo;s life at this
time as a pupil. Soon the young man became like a son
to Leonardo. Of handsome appearance, he had the sensitivity
to appreciate the essential loneliness of Leonardo
and so, almost without realizing it, he filled a gap in
Leonardo&rsquo;s life that was to last until the end of his days.</p>
<p>Yet, as Franceso de&rsquo; Melzi opened one door of Leonardo&rsquo;s
life another door closed. He received word that
his beloved uncle Francesco had died at Vinci and that
he had become the heir to his uncle&rsquo;s property. No
sooner had this news been delivered when Leonardo was
notified that Giuliano, a son of Piero, and now a lawyer
in his own right, was contesting the will. All the frustrations
of his life in Florence now rose to an angry pitch
and he set out once again for Florence to fight for his
own rights.</p>
<p>Wisely, Leonardo had armed himself with letters from
his new, influential patrons and even one from King
Louis himself recommending, &ldquo;... we request that you
will cause this dispute to be settled in the best and briefest
delivery of justice....&rdquo; In August of that same year&mdash;1507&mdash;Charles
d&rsquo;Amboise added his personal letter
suggesting that the king could not spare Leonardo too
long from the court at Milan.</p>
<p>It was with the title of Painter and Engineer to the
<span class="pb" id="Page_118">118</span>
King of France that Leonardo rode back to Florence to
await the outcome of the judges in his case. He went to
stay with a sculptor friend, Giovanni Rustici, a man of
thirty-five and also an ex-student of Verrochio. They
lived in a house lent to Rustici by a wealthy scholar and
patron named Piero Martelli.</p>
<p>Leonardo soon found that he and Rustici had much in
common. Rustici, too, collected the odds and ends of
his journeys into the country. Flying about the house
were a tame eagle and a raven, while, at dinner, a pet
porcupine begged for food. Rustici, however, was a
believer in alchemy and magic. To practice these arts
the young man devoted one room to the strange mixtures
which bubbled over flames as he attempted to change
base metals into gold, or to call upon the spirits to predict
the future.</p>
<p>Leonardo settled into the life of the house very
quickly and even helped his friend on an important
sculpture commission. This was a group composition of
St. John between the Pharisee and the Levite for over
the doors of the baptistry. He also started to gather together
his scattered notes on all the subjects that he had
written about, going through them making corrections
and erasing the repetitions. Possibly Leonardo was considering
the publication of all his material for he wrote,
&ldquo;Begun at Florence in the house of Piero di Braccio
Martelli, on the 22nd day of March, 1508. This will be
a collection without order, made up of many sheets
which I have copied here, hoping afterwards to arrange
them in order in their proper places according to the
subjects of which they treat....&rdquo; This &ldquo;collection
without order&rdquo; of almost forty years extended into practically
all branches of human knowledge, founded on
years of observation and experiment. Indeed, it was the
magnificent effort of one extraordinary mind to push
back the curtains of ignorance in order to let the light of
<span class="pb" id="Page_119">119</span>
natural truth shine through to mankind.</p>
<p>In addition, Leonardo returned to his studies of anatomy
and comparative anatomy. For this latter he made
many beautiful drawings of the legs of animals as compared
to those of man. With them, Leonardo tried
to indicate man&rsquo;s place in the natural order of the world.
He pointed out that our physical bodies are basically
the same as those of animals, and that the muscular and
organic differences are those of function only. For example,
bird and man have the same chest muscles, called
the pectoralis. But the bird, in order to fly, has developed
these into powerful instruments of motion. Man, on the
other hand, has learned to stand and move in an upright
position. He has developed the muscles of the back,
called the erectores spinae, and those of the buttocks to
hold him erect. Leonardo intended to enlarge upon his
studies of comparative anatomy to include all living
creatures, even the insects.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Viceroy of Milan was becoming impatient
for Leonardo&rsquo;s return. The judgment against his
half-brothers had been settled in Leonardo&rsquo;s favor, and
he hastened back to Milan. By the summer of 1508 he
was once more in the routine of the court&rsquo;s activities.
King Louis had granted Leonardo a regular allowance
and it was the first time he had enjoyed such a long
freedom from the concerns of earning a living. With
these steady payments Leonardo now had the leisure and
support to pursue his own multitude of interests.</p>
<p>As his notes began to take shape and he thought of
<span class="pb" id="Page_120">120</span>
printing them, it was natural for the inventive Leonardo
to design his own printing press. It is one of the
earliest such designs on record. Because the carrying bed
which held the type and the paper was automatically
adjusted to the handlebar, the press could be operated by
one man. Besides his notes Leonardo also considered
printing a work by Roger Bacon, the thirteenth century
English scientist.</p>
<p>This project for printing his own books, however,
was never realized by Leonardo. Lately, he had received
a commission which took him back in memory to the
days of Ludovico. The subject was Marshal Gian Giacomo
Trivulzio, a soldier-of-fortune. Originally this man
was a loyal commander of Galeazzo Sforza&rsquo;s but when
Ludovico came to power he had had Trivulzio banished
from Milan. Embittered, Trivulzio had become a stubborn
enemy of Ludovico from that time on, serving
under any banner that marched against the house of
Sforza. A stocky, square-faced man, his body was covered
with the scars of many battles. He had been fighting
with the French ever since the time Ludovico had betrayed
Charles VIII. Trivulzio had seen the great monument
that Leonardo had modeled and, although it was
riddled by French arrows and damaged by wind and
rain, the Marshal was impressed and wished for a similar
memorial to himself.</p>
<p>Leonardo set to work immediately. His past experience
with the Sforza monument was now to his advantage.
This time there was no need for experimenting.
He knew how much material he needed and the approximate
cost of everything including the casting. He
submitted an estimate of three thousand and forty&mdash;six
ducats for the completed work, one hundred of which
would go to Leonardo. The sum was acceptable to Trivulzio
<span class="pb" id="Page_121">121</span>
and Leonardo began his preliminary studies.</p>
<p>As he gathered the material for this new equestrian
statue, Leonardo and the French Viceroy Charles d&rsquo;Amboise
became interested in the further canalization of
the plains of Lombardy. The use of canals and locks had
been in practice for roughly a hundred years and around
Milan there were already some fifty miles of canals and
about twenty-five locks. Leonardo started another survey
of the area. In his imagination, he envisioned a vast
hydraulic engineering project.</p>
<p>On September 12, 1508 Leonardo announced in his
notes the beginning of a book on the nature of water. He
had decided to separate this book from the one on hydraulics
because it was necessary to separate theory and
practice. His pages treating the science of hydraulics,
or the practical applications of water power, had reached
to &ldquo;forty books of benefits.&rdquo; By the spring of 1509 he
had expanded his notes on the nature of water to include
the greatest wave to the smallest raindrop.</p>
<p>Concerning the practical applications of water power,
Leonardo put forth many designs for new locks. He
introduced new methods of raising the gates by windlasses
and chains which could easily be set in motion by
one man. But most important is Leonardo&rsquo;s discovery of
the use of centrifugal force for draining marshes&mdash;the
ancestor of the centrifugal pump. When you rapidly
rotate a stick in a pail of water, the water spins in a spiral
rising on the sides, and, if you rotate the stick fast enough
it bares the bottom of the pail. When you remove the
stick suddenly, the water continues to whirl as it slowly
subsides.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">122</div>
<p>This is basically the same principle Leonardo used to
raise the water from a marsh to a level above the sea
so that it could be drained away.</p>
<p>The centrifugal pump was also used with a hydraulic
screw which converted water power to mechanical
power. The force of a stream of water was injected into
the base of a vertical cylinder. In the base of this cylinder
was a six-bladed propeller mounted on a vertical shaft.
The force of the water turned the screw and at the same
time the water was forced to rise in the cylinder to an
outlet above. The turning propeller revolved the vertical
shaft. This shaft, emerging from the top of the
cylinder, turned a cogged wheel. This wheel was joined
to another cogged wheel mounted on a horizontal shaft,
thus providing the mechanical power. Not only is this
the forerunner of the turbine, but the use of the propeller,
itself, for propulsion in water, was a new idea not
to be thought of again until the eighteenth century. For
certain types of hydraulic pumps he conceived of the
cone-headed mitre valve still in use today.</p>
<p>Leonardo, besides studying the practical applications
of water power, explored the very nature of water itself.
In his proposed books on this subject he intended to
examine why clouds and fog form, why rain falls and
the raindrop itself&mdash;even how the raindrop is held together.
He understood the nature of capillary attraction,
which holds the raindrop together, and his notes show
us that he was exploring the science of hydrostatics
which relates to the pressure and equilibrium of liquids in
general.</p>
<p>Now that Leonardo had a steady income and the
<span class="pb" id="Page_123">123</span>
relief from meeting painting commissions by fixed dates,
he was free to explore his other favorite avenues of
knowledge. It seemed that his ever-active mind could
never stop roaming over the whole field of scientific
knowledge. He continued with his early interests&mdash;the
nature and movement of air, astronomy and geometry.
He was also still concerned with movement and weight,
for he set down in his notes, &ldquo;The thing which moves
will be so much the more difficult to stop as it is of
greater weight.&rdquo; This is a hint at a principle formulated
by Isaac Newton almost two hundred years later
in his First Law of Motion&mdash;the law concerning inertia.
For example, the motion of an arrow shot into the air
maintains itself in flight so long as the influence of the
initial force is maintained in it.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_124">124</div>
<p>On a note dated April 28, 1509 he wrote, &ldquo;Having for
a long time sought to square the angle of two curved
sides ... I have solved the proposition at ten o&rsquo;clock
on the evening of Sunday.&rdquo; As always, Leonardo was
deeply involved in the study of mathematics. Too deep
perhaps to recognize the new rumblings of war.</p>
<p>Louis XII, still pursuing his campaign in northern
Italy, had again arrived in Milan amid the salutes of the
French artillery. Following his personal banner of a
gold porcupine on a white field, he had come back prepared
to do battle with the Venetians whose power, as
it diminished in the east, was extending westward into
Italy. Alarmed at this Venetian expansion, the French
King had allied himself with Pope Julius II and the
powers of Europe to form the League of Cambrai to
push back this threat. Charles d&rsquo;Amboise, the French
Viceroy, had already taken to the field and at the castle
of Cassano, overlooking the Adda river near Milan, he
awaited the arrival of his king.</p>
<p>By the end of May, Leonardo was in the saddle once
more. Surrounded by the best knights of France and
the nobles of Milan, he personally accompanied the
French King as military engineer to the meeting with
the Viceroy of Milan at Cassano.</p>
<p>During the next three months, through the battles
and defeat of the Venetians at Aquadello where sixteen
thousand dead were left on the field, and the siege
of Caravaggio and the capture of Peschiera, Leonardo
served as military consultant and map maker. More than
ever his eye was attracted to the possibilities of utilizing
the many rivers they crossed both for warfare and commerce.
He envisioned making the Adda river navigable
from Milan to Lake Como. During this time, he devised
not only a revolving bridge but even one of two layers
in a single span&mdash;the upper level for pedestrians and the
<span class="pb" id="Page_125">125</span>
lower one for vehicles.</p>
<p>By July, Leonardo had returned with the king and
the French army to Milan. Here was planned a great
celebration of the French victory over the Venetians.
In front of the cathedral, to the delight of the hundreds
of spectators, Leonardo devised a mechanical lion scaring
a dragon out of an artificial lake into the beak of a cock
which picked the dragon&rsquo;s eyes out. After the festivities
Leonardo returned to his everyday work. In time, he
had a thriving workshop and as he became more and
more preoccupied with his scientific explorations, his
art commissions were turned over to his assistants. He
did continue, however, to work on the plans for Marshal
Trivulzio&rsquo;s monument and in his preparatory work for
this assignment he expanded his notes and drawings of
comparative anatomy.</p>
<p>This renewed interest in anatomy led him to attend
a lecture in the winter of 1509. The lecturer was Marcantonio
della Torre, a young man in his late twenties
and one of the best-known anatomists of the times. He
had been a professor at the University of Padua, but this
city had fallen into the hands of the Venetians. Marcantonio
was forced to flee Padua and had settled at Pavia.
The two men, when they met, recognized in each other
a devotion to science and they began a professional collaboration
that grew into a friendship. Leonardo now
developed his anatomy studies to the point where he is
today recognized as the foremost medical anatomist of
the Renaissance.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">126</div>
<p>Returning to his dissections, Leonardo now proceeded
to explore the heart and system of veins in the human
body. His drawings of the heart are nearly perfect. Indeed,
he was probably the first to discover the endocardium
membrane that sheathes the valves and sinews
of the heart. Also, he pictured and described the moderator
band, &ldquo;the first cause of the motion of the heart.&rdquo;
His work on this organ led him to the doorstep of discovering
the circulation of the blood&mdash;later to be carried
out by William Harvey in the seventeenth century.</p>
<p>Further, Leonardo was the first to accurately draw a
representation of the <i>foetus</i>, or unborn child, in the
womb of its mother, writing in his notes that, &ldquo;we conclude
therefore, that a single soul governs the bodies and
nourishes the two.&rdquo; In addition, he drew a remarkable
picture of the female figure and for the first time accurately
placed her organic structure. In his notes, he also
pointed the way to the laws governing metabolism when
he wrote, &ldquo;The body of anything whatsoever that receives
nourishment continually dies and is continually
renewed....&rdquo; By pouring wax into a hole in the skull
he made the first casts of the ventricles of the brain. Several
hundred years were to pass before this method was
rediscovered.</p>
<p>As Leonardo&rsquo;s work progressed, his admiration for
the complexity of the human body grew. Many times
in the middle of explaining a section of anatomy he inserted
a sentence or two of wonder or praise at the
magnificent creation that is the human being. Indeed,
these drawings and notes represent the sum of many,
many dissections; moreover, Leonardo had to work
under conditions that placed many obstacles in his
path&mdash;the crude lights and instruments, the difficulties of
obtaining corpses and, above all, the opposition of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_127">127</span>
superstitious and ignorant.</p>
<p>The following year Leonardo entered in his notes,
&ldquo;This winter of the year 1510 I look to finish all this
anatomy.&rdquo; And yet, however sincerely he might express
such a wish, Leonardo was a person who was literally
never &ldquo;finished.&rdquo; The scientific and artistic tasks he had
chosen for himself were clearly beyond the limits of any
one man. Besides, the pressures of the outside world
were once more threatening the peace and quiet of his
home and work.</p>
<p>Pope Julius II became increasingly fearful of the
French victories over the Venetians. Secretly, he concluded
a peace with Venice and, allying himself with
his former enemy, he now turned against the French.
When the conflict continued, Charles d&rsquo;Amboise, the
patron of Leonardo, was killed at the battle of Correggio.
He was replaced by a new French Viceroy, Gaston
de Foix. Although the Pope now hired Swiss mercenaries,
this invasion from the North was defeated by the
young Gaston. Not to be outdone, the Pope then
brought in Spanish troops.</p>
<p>In the ensuing bloody battle at Ravenna, the French
completely defeated the armies of the Pope and Spain,
despite their use of battle-cars armed with razor-sharp
sickles on their wheels&mdash;strangely like the early inventions
that Leonardo designed for Lorenzo de&rsquo; Medici!
Although the French were victorious, they lost their
brilliant young leader, Gaston de Foix, and with him
they lost their heart. As a result, they were soon disorganized.
The Pope&rsquo;s armies renewed their attacks,
<span class="pb" id="Page_128">128</span>
and the French began a long retreat.</p>
<p>Once again the plague infested Milan and Leonardo&rsquo;s
friend, Marcantonio della Torre, died of it. After some
futile attempts at recovery, the French fled across the
Alps and with them went Marshal Trivulzio. Milan was
left temporarily under the martial rule of the Swiss,
and Leonardo with only his few apprentices was left
again without a patron.</p>
<p>Tired and prematurely old at sixty-one, Leonardo resignedly
gathered his possessions together once more
and with Francesco de&rsquo; Melzi and four of his loyal pupils,
he turned his back on Milan for the last time. The date
was September 29, 1513. Their destination was Rome.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">129</div>

<br /><i>Rome</i></h2>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="49" />
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leonardo da Vinci.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where from and where are you staying?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are coming from Milan by way of Florence. I
have quarters being prepared for me at the Belvedere in
the Vatican&mdash;by order of the Pope. Now, young man,
let us pass.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The guard at the Porta del Popolo changed his manner.
He dropped his halberd and motioned to the other
guards to let the riders through. He touched his helmet
roughly and with a grin he said,</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Sire&mdash;but you know how it is. All these
<span class="pb" id="Page_130">130</span>
people&mdash;there&rsquo;s bound to be them that we don&rsquo;t want
here. Go ahead, your Excellency. Make way there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With these words he laid his spear against a jostling
group of broad-hatted pilgrims blocking the entrance
to the city of Rome.</p>
<p>Leonardo heeled his horse and with Francesco de&rsquo;
Melzi at his side, followed by his servant and students,
pushed past the crowd at the gate. To the left rose the
Pincio hill with its stately pines where, in the days of
Imperial Rome, Lucullus had walked in his gardens.
But Leonardo had no time to look about. It was a damp
December day, and rain threatened from the gray skies.
He was tired, and as Francesco glanced at him he could
see Leonardo pull his cape around him with a little
shiver as the chill wind stirred the long, graying hair
on his shoulders. They made their way through the
crowded, noisy city. They crossed the Tiber and rode
past Castel&rsquo; Sant&rsquo; Angelo, the papal fortress built on the
tomb of Emperor Hadrian. After another inspection
by the Swiss guards in beribboned uniforms of white,
green and gold under their shining breastplates, they
entered the walls of the Vatican. That evening after
he had settled himself in the Belvedere apartments and
dinner had been eaten, Leonardo, gazing into the embers
of the fire, looked back over his new stroke of fortune.</p>
<p>The Medicis had returned to power. Pope Julius II
<span class="pb" id="Page_131">131</span>
had died, and Giovanni de&rsquo; Medici, son of Lorenzo, had
become Pope Leo X at the age of thirty-seven. With
his election to the head of the Christian world, the Republic
of Florence became a city of the Medicis once
more and Leonardo had received an appointment in
Rome. Giuliano de&rsquo; Medici, Pope Leo&rsquo;s favorite younger
brother, in his new rise to power and wealth, became
Leonardo&rsquo;s patron. The two must have met sometime
during the Medici&rsquo;s exile. Leonardo was given the apartments
in the Vatican and a salary of thirty-three ducats
(approximately eighty-five dollars) a month and a
workshop was fitted for him and his pupils. He was also
assigned an exclusive German assistant named Georg.</p>
<p>The Pope&rsquo;s court in the Vatican was like the Medici
court in the Florence of Leonardo&rsquo;s youth&mdash;multiplied
by hundreds. Leo X saw himself as the center of the
artistic world, and being a man of luxurious tastes with
the wealth of the church behind him, the Vatican was
soon filled with a mixture of the wise and foolish. Pompous
classic-quoters, third-rate poets and clowns mixed
with the world&rsquo;s scholars and statesmen. The two greatest
artists were Bramante, the architect and friend of
Leonardo&rsquo;s first years in Milan, and Bramante&rsquo;s pupil
Raphael, the painter.</p>
<p>Bramante was busy building the new church of St.
Peter&rsquo;s and, as the architect of this favorite project of
the Popes, he was sole master of the Roman art world.
Raphael, as his protege, was the recipient of the better
painting commissions in Rome. The elderly Bramante
and the thirty-year-old assistant were a famous pair in
the Rome of 1513. Equally as famous, however, was
Michelangelo; he was still living in Rome, but was without
patronage after Julius II&rsquo;s death. Leonardo&rsquo;s old
rival had scored his triumph with his extraordinary paintings
in the Sistine Chapel.</p>
<p>Although the young Raphael, who owed so much to
<span class="pb" id="Page_132">132</span>
the example of Leonardo, now rode through the streets
as a wealthy nobleman, Leonardo himself received no
great commissions. While Pope Leo was indulgent of
his brother&rsquo;s whims he himself had no use for this tall,
serious old man who roamed the shaded walks of the
Vatican poking at the strange plants in the botanical
garden or making drawings of the foreign animals in the
private zoo. In reality, Leonardo&rsquo;s patron, Giuliano de&rsquo;
Medici was a weak man. He played at being a patron
but, like his brother the Pope, he lacked the force and
decision of his famous father Lorenzo. Nevertheless,
he did give Leonardo one small commission for a picture.
Immediately Leonardo, excited by the exotic plants in
the Vatican gardens, commenced to experiment with
them to find a resin to make a varnish with which to
cover the future painting. Pope Leo made fun of him
exclaiming, to the delight of his court, &ldquo;This man will
never get anything done, he thinks of the end before
the beginning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This ridicule by the Pope made Leonardo a joke to
many in the circles of the Vatican who were a little
afraid of this strange man with the searching eyes. Leonardo
also suffered the humiliations of a man who did
not conform to the fashions of his day. His knowledge
of Latin, for example, was weak and although he could
read it with the help of a dictionary he could not speak
it. And, among the people who surrounded the Pope,
Latin was the only language allowed. Prizes of great
sums of money and important positions were often
granted on the strength of an improvised speech in
Latin (with many quotations from the classical authors)
or a flattering Latin verse. Faced with such setbacks and
ridicule, Leonardo&mdash;not surprisingly&mdash;began to withdraw
into himself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">133</div>
<p>And yet, Leonardo refused to remain idle&mdash;he had
to work. The need for mirrors in the vast halls and rooms
of the papal palace was great. Leonardo turned his
mechanical skill to redesigning and improving methods
of making them, and even inventing his own machines
for the grinding of the glass. Also, for Giuliano, who
dabbled in alchemy and magic, he made distorting mirrors
and burning lenses. In addition, Leonardo invented
a machine which could be run hydraulically for producing
long strips of copper of equal width for use in soldering
the mirrors.</p>
<p>But, with the making of these mirrors, Leonardo began
to run into trouble with his German assistant, Georg.
The boy was a loafer; he spoke little Italian and took
every opportunity to spend his days with his countrymen
in the Swiss guard. Leonardo tried to alter the situation
by suggesting that the boy have his meals with him
at his worktable, thus giving Georg a better chance to
learn the language. This however did not appeal to him.
Then, because Leonardo&rsquo;s inventions were so extraordinary,
he began to give away the secrets of their mechanisms
to Johannes the mirror-maker, another German,
who had been replaced by Leonardo in the favors of
Giuliano. This naturally made Johannes jealous of Leonardo.
Georg gossiped, too, and told stories about the
old, eccentric man who lived like a miser in the midst of
all the luxury and who drew crazy circles on pages of
paper.</p>
<p>These &ldquo;crazy circles&rdquo; were geometric exercises that
<span class="pb" id="Page_134">134</span>
had fascinated Leonardo from the time he had wandered
across Italy with Fra Luca Pacioli. Pacioli&rsquo;s book <i>De
Divina Proportione</i>, containing sixty illustrations from
designs of Leonardo, had been published in Venice in
1509. Leonardo intended to entitle these geometric exercises
<i>De Ludo Geometrico</i>. In geometry a lune is a
crescent-shaped figure bounded by two intersecting
arcs of circles on a plane or a sphere. Leonardo drew
pages of these lunes and then proceeded to transform
their curvilinear figures into squares of equal area. He
also reviewed Archimedes&rsquo; method of squaring a circle
and developed it into a variety of ways for cubing
spheres and cylinders.</p>
<p>He returned as well to formulating theories of friction.
He wrote in his notes, &ldquo;the tallest wheel is the easiest
to pull&rdquo;&mdash;for example, a big wheel turning at the same
speed as a smaller one has less friction to overcome because
it makes less revolutions. His experiments in friction
predated men like Amontons and Coulomb by two
and three centuries. He established a formula for the
building arch which he described as &ldquo;a strength caused
by two weaknesses&rdquo;&mdash;if one half of an arch is removed,
the other half collapses. They support and give strength
to each other. In addition, Leonardo determined, before
Galileo, the center of gravity of any pyramid and of a
tetrahedral, or four-sided body.</p>
<p>As the days went by and he waited for commissions
to come, Leonardo took to wandering about the streets
of Rome. He stood in the half-buried Forum of the
Caesars surrounded by grazing sheep and grunting pigs.
Wooden shacks where crude cartwheels were made and
where the marble from the ancient temples was cut and
sold, were built against the sides of crumbling ruins.
The old triumphal arches, now overgrown with creepers,
were boarded into towers and cattle were penned
<span class="pb" id="Page_135">135</span>
between the shafts of columns that once supported the
grandeur of temple roofs. Here and there a classical
scholar would be sketching or writing from the worn,
Latin inscriptions on a marble slab tilted crazily from the
ground where it had fallen hundreds of years ago.
Goats wandered on the Palatine hill, once the home of
Emperors, and the great baths of the Emperor Diocletian
were now a deer park and a hunting ground for royalty.</p>
<p>During the course of these wanderings, Leonardo became
interested in the primitive methods of carpentry.
Such things as screws, for example, were rare. Those
that were used were either made of wood or, if of metal,
by goldsmiths laboriously making each one by hand,
soldering wire around a pin and another wire into the
hole to hold the screw. Sometimes they were made by
filing pieces of metal individually. All these methods
were time-consuming and costly.</p>
<p>Leonardo had thought of this problem before, and
now he concentrated on perfecting his ideas about it.
Previously, he had thought of casting the metal in
wooden molds and then turning the metal on thread-cutters.
The designs he finally drew in careful detail,
however, are essentially the methods used today. The
new machines did with a few turns of a handle and
adjustments of a few cogged wheels what it took one
man many hours to perform. He also drew designs for
a mechanical plane and a machine for drawing wire that
worked by water power.</p>
<p>Leonardo now lived and worked in the Belvedere of
the Vatican&mdash;more a man on exhibition than an active
participant in the great artistic activities taking place
around him. True, he received his thirty-three ducats
a month, but Michelangelo had been paid three thousand
for his work in the Sistine Chapel, while Raphael had
earned twelve thousand for each room he painted in the
Vatican.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">136</div>
<div class="img" id="fig16">
<img src="images/pg075.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="797" />
<p class="pcap"><i>Leonardo became interested in various methods of carpentry.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">137</div>
<p>Thus Leonardo drifted farther and farther away from
his painting. This, in itself, caused people to talk in the
papal city. For he had earned fame as a painter, but his
passion for science was regarded as strange and whimsical.
Occasionally, he did receive a small commission
from the workshop of Raphael, yet these were like the
crumbs from a rich man&rsquo;s table.</p>
<p>Even the toys Leonardo made at this period for the
amusement of his patrons were looked upon as somewhat
weird. For example, he would take small pieces
of wax and mold them into strange little animals and
then inflate them so that they floated in the air in front of
a startled guest. Once he caught a curious lizard in the
garden and spent hours putting scales all over the tiny
body, attached to it a little beard and horns, then let
it out from a box at a banquet. The guests jumped back
with fear and the women became hysterical.</p>
<p>One of Leonardo&rsquo;s jokes that has been passed down
in accounts of his life at this period must have created
quite a sensation. He showed the company the cleaned
entrails of a sheep resting on the palm of his hand. After
telling them to wait and watch he took the entrails in
another room and with a bellows inflated them with
warm air. As the entrails filled with air they expanded
and extended. They crept into the room where the company
waited. Slowly they grew and grew until they began
to fill the room. The guests overturned their chairs
in their hurry to get out of the way of this shapeless,
translucent creature. Then Leonardo appeared, the air-filled
<span class="pb" id="Page_138">138</span>
entrails giving way before him, and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sires, this is but an example and symbol of virtue.
As you can see, the smallest virtue is capable of the
greatest growth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The guests laughed, but it was an uncomfortable
laugh. Thus another story was added to the legend of
Leonardo as an odd old man.</p>
<p>Leonardo, whose work&mdash;particularly his anatomical
studies&mdash;had constantly been interrupted by the fortunes
of war, had found another hospital in Rome where he
could continue these studies. This time it was his intention
to write a treatise on speech. He dissected and
drew the anatomy of the larynx (the voice box), the
vocal cords and the trachea (the air passage to the lungs),
and all the muscles that control the movements of the
tongue and the lips. If you pronounce each letter of the
alphabet you will feel these muscles of the lips, especially
with the letters &ldquo;o,&rdquo; &ldquo;p,&rdquo; and &ldquo;f.&rdquo; Carefully he noted
how the air vibrations from the trachea form themselves
into vowels and consonants, and he drew the membrane
which, when air is pressed against it, makes the sound
&ldquo;aah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this same time he was also busy finishing a treatise
on painting which he had begun when he was working
on the &ldquo;Last Supper&rdquo; for Ludovico Sforza. But it was
for his knowledge of military engineering that he was
sent to the city of Parma by the Pope on September 25,
1514. Here he stayed at the Bell Inn while examining the
fortifications and other defenses of the city.</p>
<p>Leonardo&rsquo;s patron, Giuliano de&rsquo; Medici, had been
<span class="pb" id="Page_139">139</span>
appointed governor of this particular area and, since
Pope Leo X was fearful of two powerful countries,
France and Spain, he was preparing the papal territory
against possible invasion. Another fear of the Pope&mdash;and
indeed of everybody in Rome&mdash;was malaria, the
disease carried by the mosquitoes that bred in the Pontine
marshes west and southwest of the city. At that
time, however, no one knew the cause was mosquitoes;
rather, they thought it was the bad air from the
marshes.</p>
<p>As Leonardo had already been effective in draining
the pestilential marshes of Piombino for Cesare Borgia
and, later, those around Milan for Charles d&rsquo;Amboise,
he was assigned the same task for the Pontine marshes.
He surveyed the entire area to the sea and made another
extraordinary aerial type map. His recommendations
included draining the entire area, enlarging and regulating
the Martino river and cutting an extra outlet from
the river Livoli to the sea. These plans were adopted
some years later and parts of the marshes were drained
successfully, yielding new land for the cultivation of
crops.</p>
<p>By December of 1514 Leonardo had finished his
treatise on speech and, possibly in an effort to attract the
attention of the Pope, he submitted it to the Privy-Chamberlain,
Battista dell&rsquo;Aquila. As Pope Leo was surrounded
by an army of secretaries and assistants who
passed on everything submitted, this manuscript with its
beautiful drawings was mislaid and lost and only a few
notes and sketches remain.</p>
<p>The continual discouragement of his life in Rome was
<span class="pb" id="Page_140">140</span>
offset by a visit from his half-brother, Giuliano, around
Christmas. Leonardo was held in esteem by his family
despite the quarrel over his father&rsquo;s and his uncle Francesco&rsquo;s
will, and his half-brothers were pleased to tell
of their famous relative who lived in the Belvedere as
guest of the Medicis. Yet they knew little of Leonardo&rsquo;s
scientific dreams and his lack of recognition in the papal
city.</p>
<p>Often, Leonardo&rsquo;s greatest comfort was to return to
his notes. The challenge of geometry and the mysteries
of the movement of air and water kept him from brooding
about his lonely life. Francesco de&rsquo; Melzi, Leonardo&rsquo;s
young friend, had more and more taken over
the practical responsibilities of his everyday life. Except
for his workshop, where the troublesome Georg
worked at the making of mirrors, and an occasional
small commission for a painting, Leonardo was free to
study.</p>
<p>In addition to his geometrical investigations, Leonardo
now experimented with the science of <i>statics</i> (objects
that are stationary), and <i>dynamics</i> (objects in motion).
One of his most important discoveries in the
science of mechanics came about during this period.
Concerning the division of weight, he wrote, &ldquo;There
are three conditions of gravity of which the one is its
simple natural gravity, the second is its accidental gravity,
the third the friction produced by it. But the natural
weight is in itself unchangeable, the accidental which
is joined to it is of infinite force, and the friction varies
according to the places wherein it occurs, namely rough
or smooth places.&rdquo; Thus he realized and formulated
what composes the movement of an object. He found
that movement is the result of separate forces acting
upon the object from different directions, as for example,
the initial push, the pull of gravity and the
resistance of friction. And, before Galileo, Leonardo
further experimented with objects dropped from a
height. As the result of repeated experiments, he noted
that the fall was being affected by the earth&rsquo;s rotation.
That is, the object dropped always fell in a slight eastward
direction rather than vertically downward&mdash;a
fact later proved conclusively by Isaac Newton and
<span class="pb" id="Page_141">141</span>
Robert Hooke in the next century.</p>
<p>He also became fascinated with spiral motion, such
as is found in a spinning top or in a whirlpool of water.
Because of his interest in <i>hydrodynamics</i>, or the movement
of water, he began to sketch imaginary &ldquo;Deluge
compositions.&rdquo; These were drawings showing the
world&mdash;probably inspired by the Bible&mdash;in a chaos of
wind and floods. They were based on his years of scientific
research. Indeed, his drawings of actual whirlpools
are still among the greatest of his scientific art. Today,
with all the latest technical aids, such as dusting a whirlpool
with powdered rosin and then photographing it, an
accurate three-dimensional picture is impossible. Yet
Leonardo, by sheer observation and analysis coupled
with his genius for drawing, could reproduce the complicated
shape of whirling water.</p>
<p>In the relatedness of his explorations of water, air and
movement, and weight, he worked out the similarity
between the laws of equilibrium controlling solids and
liquids. The equation between the motive force and
resistance that makes for equilibrium or balance in solids
can be compared to the equation between the upward
pressure of liquids and the downward pressure exerted
on them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">142</div>
<p>Far into the night Leonardo worked on his papers.
He tired more easily now, and his eyes had grown
weaker. To provide the increase in light that his failing
eyesight demanded, he had improved on his original oil
lamp by making the wick rise as the oil was burned
away, and he had extra lamps fitted to the ceiling.</p>
<p>On January 9, 1515 Leonardo wrote in his notes, &ldquo;Il
Magnifico Giuliano de&rsquo; Medici set out on the ninth day
of January 1515 at daybreak from Rome, to go and
marry a wife in Savoy. And on that day came the news
of the death of the King of France (Louis XII).&rdquo; This
meant that his new patron had left and his old patron
had died. Leonardo&rsquo;s note was a sad one and perhaps
he felt, in the departure of his patron, more alone than
ever in the crowded life of the Vatican. Giuliano, on the
urging of his brother, was marrying Philiberta of Savoy,
in an effort to strengthen the prestige of the Medici.
Louis XII, before he died, had formed a league against
Spain, and with the marriage of the Pope&rsquo;s brother to a
noble house of France, the league would be strengthened
by keeping the Pope on the side of France. Actually
Pope Leo was playing both sides, for at the time
he was also friendly with Spain.</p>
<p class="tb">Shortly after Giuliano&rsquo;s departure from Rome, Leonardo
fell ill, presumably from a mild heart attack complicated
by a touch of malarial fever. The doctor had
been called. It was a warning, the doctor told Francesco
de&rsquo; Melzi, and Leonardo must remain quiet for quite
awhile.</p>
<p>By the end of the winter Leonardo was back on his
feet and apparently feeling completely well again.
<span class="pb" id="Page_143">143</span>
Giuliano himself had fallen ill about the same time and
the news that he had recovered and was finally returning
to Rome cheered Leonardo. He sat down and wrote
a long letter to his patron expressing his joy. This letter
also included a long list of complaints against Georg
and Johannes. Georg was now using his room in Leonardo&rsquo;s
apartment to do work for others. He lied to
Leonardo and flew into such a rage when he was questioned
that no one could go near him. Moreover,
Johannes, the mirror-maker, was now moving back
into the Vatican and turning out mirrors for everyone,
even using Georg&rsquo;s room as his own workroom.
Johannes boasted of his skill and told everybody that
Leonardo did not know what he was doing. Thus, it
was not surprising that Leonardo, in his long complaint,
was taking out the anger and frustration he felt against
all the injustices of his life in Rome.</p>
<p>But by summer Leonardo was again employed as a
military engineer. Francis I had succeeded to the throne
of France. The new French King was anxious to secure
his lost title to the Dukedom of Milan and was preparing
another invasion of Italy. Pope Leo X, still trying to
play both sides at once, was making secret agreements
with Francis while at the same time joining the King of
Spain, Milan, Genoa, and the Swiss in an alliance against
France. Consequently, he sent Leonardo out to inspect
the fortifications of Civitavecchia, a city on the Tyrrhenian
coast not too far from Rome. When, in August,
Francis I crossed into Italy with an army of thirty-five
thousand men including Marshal Trivulzio, the Pope
ordered his brother, Giuliano, to take command of the
papal forces. On the way to assume this command,
Giuliano fell ill and collapsed. His sickness this time was
<span class="pb" id="Page_144">144</span>
soon to be fatal.</p>
<p>Leonardo returned to Rome with his survey of
Civitavecchia, where he immediately learned of his
patron&rsquo;s latest illness. Perhaps realizing that Giuliano
was fatally ill, Leonardo made a desperate effort to gain
the recognition he felt should be his. He entered the
competition for a new fa&ccedil;ade of San Lorenzo in Florence.
Among the other competitors was Michelangelo,
his younger and yet oldest rival.</p>
<p>In October of 1515, Francis I had recaptured Milan
and by Christmas was in Rome. Leonardo may have met
the new King of France in Bologna where Pope Leo X
had personally traveled in order to settle a peace treaty
with France. Certainly it is known that he attended
Francis&rsquo; court in Rome. Leonardo&rsquo;s name was well respected
in French circles and, as Francis had already
admired the pictures by Leonardo, the meeting was a
happy occasion for them both. Indeed, the recognition
that Leonardo had sought in his native land was never
as great as that accorded to him by the French.</p>
<p>As Francis I prepared to leave for France in January
he must have offered Leonardo a position at his court.
While he still hoped that Giuliano de&rsquo; Medici would
recover from his illness and return to Rome, Francis&rsquo;
offer gave him support in the knowledge that he had a
powerful, new friend.</p>
<p>March of 1516 brought the first of three events that
<span class="pb" id="Page_145">145</span>
were to change the course of Leonardo&rsquo;s last years.
Giuliano de&rsquo; Medici died, leaving Leonardo not only
without a patron, but without a friend in the Vatican.
Now sixty-four years old, he was reluctant to leave his
comfortable quarters in the Belvedere with its workshop
and pleasant gardens. Besides, deep within himself, he
felt that Rome could still offer him the fame that had
always escaped him.</p>
<p>Spring ripened into summer and the second event
occurred. The competition for the new fa&ccedil;ade of San
Lorenzo in Florence was won by Michelangelo. To
Leonardo the news was a blow. The success of his old
rival weakened his position in the Vatican even further
and added to the growing hostility he had felt in the
people surrounding the Pope.</p>
<p>The third event was the sum of many small events.
Georg and his friend Johannes, in their jealousy, had
spread much gossip about Leonardo in court circles.
They now took advantage of Giuliano&rsquo;s death to circulate
stories about Leonardo&rsquo;s dissections of bodies in
the hospital. These were added to vicious gossip that
Leonardo was pro-French. This news eventually
reached Pope Leo X. The Pope himself was perfectly
aware of the practice of dissection and, personally, he
had turned his eyes the other way. However, as dissection
was contrary to Church doctrine, an official
complaint to the head of the Church could not be
ignored. The Pope used it as an excuse to be rid of this
tiresome old man whom he had tolerated only for his
brother&rsquo;s sake. Leonardo was abandoned.</p>
<p>The year 1516 was drawing to a close. Leonardo had
<span class="pb" id="Page_146">146</span>
decided to seek the patronage offered him by Francis
I. So he and Francesco de&rsquo; Melzi, his loyal young friend,
left Rome for the long journey into France. As he left
his native land for the last time, Leonardo looked back
over his years&mdash;from the silver lute that had sent him
to Milan, to the death of Giuliano, to the final rejection
of Pope Leo X. Remembering how Lorenzo de&rsquo; Medici
had sent him to Ludovico so many years before, Leonardo
thought to himself with great sadness, &ldquo;The
Medici created and destroyed me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">147</div>
<h2 id="c13"><span class="small">13</span>
<br /><i>The Last Years</i></h2>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="49" />
</div>
<p>Leonardo looked around from where he was leaning
on the parapet of the Chateau d&rsquo;Amboise to watch a
group of young lords and ladies playing croquet on the
emerald-green lawn. The click of the mallets and balls
was mingled with the shouts and laughter of the young
people. It was late afternoon in May and although the
sun was warm the breeze from the west was chilly.
Leonardo looked down again from the sheer height of
the castle wall across the wide sweep of the Loire river
and the valley extending as far as the eye could see.
Swallows were swooping low over the banks below and
the wind carried their shrilling cries up to him. The
forested islands and sandbars interrupted the steady
flow of the river and Leonardo could see the reflections
sway in the current. He had been studying the river
but he realized that his aging eyes were not up to the
task of concentrating for long. The wind made them
<span class="pb" id="Page_148">148</span>
water, so he turned away and started back to his home.</p>
<p>There was much that was familiar in the castle at
Amboise. The thick, high walls and round towers and
especially the graceful, lacy spires of the king&rsquo;s residence
brought back much that he had known in his native
land. The gardens had been planted by Italians&mdash;there
were orange trees and even a mulberry tree from his
beloved plains of Lombardy. The king&rsquo;s residence and
chapel had been constructed and the decorations carved
in stone by Italian artisans. Leonardo could stop and
talk in his native tongue with many of the men employed
by the king. Since the time of Charles VIII, the
French had brought in the latest Renaissance styles
from Italy. Leonardo&rsquo;s steps took him back from the
castle grounds and down a path with a hand-railing. The
steep roofs of the town of Amboise with their chimneys
could be seen below him. The path led to a small
manor house, like a miniature castle with sharp spires
and lacy, carved-stone gables that was set in green lawns
and gravel paths.</p>
<p>The Manoir de Cloux, as Leonardo&rsquo;s house was
called, had been a hunting lodge for Francis I, but when
Leonardo had arrived he gave the house to Leonardo
for his home. Francis, in his admiration for this great
man, also gave him seven hundred crowns a year, together
with a pension of four hundred for Francesco
de&rsquo; Melzi.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">149</div>

<p class="pcap"><i>Leonardo at Chateau d&rsquo;Amboise on the Loire.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">150</div>
<p>The long journey from Rome had left Leonardo tired
and weak and he had fallen ill again shortly after his
arrival. This time the attack was more serious and had
left him with his right hand permanently crippled. He
looked at it now as he opened the door to his room.
&ldquo;Another warning,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;and there&rsquo;s still so
much to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young, robust King Francis was everywhere at
once. He gloried in knightly tournaments, hunts, and
sports of all kinds. Always restless, he might appear at
any place unannounced. Frequently there would be a
clamor at the gates of Leonardo&rsquo;s home and the king
would ride in with one or two of his nobles. With a
great jingling of spurs he would bound up the stairs of
the manor house calling for Leonardo. He delighted in
long talks with the old man, and would listen respectfully
as Leonardo, his deep-set eyes brooding over his
notes, would demonstrate some scientific point on a
blank sheet of paper.</p>
<p>At this time, Leonardo was engaged on three projects
which demanded his immediate attention. One
was the entertainment for a banquet that Francis was
giving for his sister, Marguerite de Valois, and her husband.
Another was a new design for the king&rsquo;s castle
at Amboise, and the third was a design for making a
navigable waterway from Amboise to Romorantin. Although
these three projects were the main ones that
occupied Leonardo&rsquo;s time, there was always the supervising
of his pupils&rsquo; painting on the walls in the little
chapel of the manor house, his own work on a painting
of St. John the Baptist, and the continual ordering and
<span class="pb" id="Page_151">151</span>
revising of his notes.</p>
<p>The banquet took place in October of 1517, and the
mechanical lion Leonardo had made was an immediate
success. It &ldquo;walked&rdquo; by means of a spring motor, into
the hall, opening and closing its fierce mouth while
swaying its head from side to side. With a wand that
he had been given, Francis I stepped down from his
seat and tapped the lion three times. The toy fell apart
and from it a cascade of white lilies poured out at the
king&rsquo;s feet.</p>
<p>Also at this time there was a distinguished guest at
the castle of Amboise. He was a fellow-countryman of
Leonardo and his name was Cardinal Luigi d&rsquo;Aragona.
With him was his secretary Antonio de&rsquo; Beatis. As
Leonardo was now a famous member of King Francis&rsquo;
court, the cardinal paid him a visit accompanied by
Antonio. The extraordinary anatomy drawings and all
his notes were shown to the cardinal; he and his secretary
were deeply impressed. They were also surprised
to learn that Leonardo had never been accorded the
same recognition by his own countrymen. Antonio
de&rsquo; Beatis wrote home that &ldquo;This gentleman has written
a treatise on anatomy, showing by illustrations the members,
muscles, nerves, veins, joints, intestines and whatever
else is to discuss in the bodies of men and women,
in a way that has never yet been done by anyone else.
All this we have seen with our own eyes; and he said
that he had dissected more than thirty bodies, both of
men and women of all ages. He has also written of the
nature of water, and of divers machines, and of other
matters which he has set down in an endless number of
volumes, all in the vulgar tongue [meaning Italian not
Latin], which, if they be published, will be profitable
<span class="pb" id="Page_152">152</span>
and delightful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By now Leonardo had accumulated thousands of
pages of notes, and they lay stacked in all manner of
chests and boxes. Often now, as Leonardo surveyed the
work of his lifetime, he realized that he would never
see the day of their publication. Time was slipping
through his fingers. Already summer had come and
gone and now the sharp winds of fall were lifting the
leaves from the ground in dancing whirls. Fortunately
these were years of peace and for the first time in a
long while the people were free of wars. The scheme
to canalize the waterway to Romorantin had grown to
a vast idea for making a thoroughfare of water from the
Loire river all the way down France to Lyons and then
into Italy! Leonardo, old and ailing as he was, had surveyed
parts of the rivers Loire and Cher, braving the
rough roads and crude accommodations.</p>
<p>In addition, Leonardo had designed a castle for Francis
I&rsquo;s widowed mother in Romorantin. This castle was
never built, but many of the ideas that Leonardo had
incorporated in its design were used in the gigantic and
magnificent castle of Chambord. Also, at Francis&rsquo; request,
he had reviewed the work being done at the castle
in Blois and there is reason to think that the beautiful
outside stairwell that spirals from left to right might
have been designed by Leonardo.</p>
<p>In February of 1517, a son had been born to Queen
<span class="pb" id="Page_153">153</span>
Claude and Francis I. The king decided to postpone the
baptism of the dauphin (the title given to the eldest son
of a French King) until May of the following year. At
that time there would be a double celebration at Amboise,
for a nephew of Pope Leo X, the young Lorenzo
de&rsquo; Medici, was being married to Madelaine d&rsquo;Auvergne.
As usual, Leonardo was given the assignment
of preparing the festivities. Although he was fond
of preparing these entertainments, Leonardo now felt
the pressure of time; for indeed, the interruptions of this
eager young king were sometimes a hardship. He felt
that his years were drawing to an end. His notes were
unfinished and his dreams of extending man&rsquo;s knowledge
of his world and of himself were hindered not only by
such petty chores but also by the limits of his own physical
endurance.</p>
<p>As Leonardo was sketching one day from the window
of his room where he could see the castle walls and
the chapel of Saint-Hubert, he set aside the drawing
for a moment to write a memorandum to himself.
&ldquo;Write of the quality of time as distinct from its
mathematical divisions.&rdquo; Was this extraordinary man
sensing the road down which Einstein&mdash;in his studies of
relativity&mdash;was to travel hundreds of years later?</p>
<p>Spring arrived again and with it came the first wild
<span class="pb" id="Page_154">154</span>
flowers and roses, the songs of the birds in the woods
and the blossoming of the chestnut trees. The time for
the double celebration came, too, and Leonardo was
seen busily preparing the decorations and mechanical
delights for the large crowds already assembling. In
addition to the tournaments-at-arms that so delighted
the king, there was to be a mock battle with a besieged
city, and for this Leonardo had had constructed imposing
castle walls of wood with a backdrop of a city&rsquo;s
spires and towers. The party lasted for weeks, and the
climax was performed on the lawns of Leonardo&rsquo;s house
where a great ballroom had been set up. Here he repeated
an earlier success, the one that had so enchanted
Ludovico&rsquo;s guests so many years ago in the Sforza castle
at Milan. There was again a dome over the ballroom
across which the stars moved mechanically and artificial
figures representing various gods and goddesses spoke
and sang by means of a hidden choir, while the sun and
moon shone in their own lights.</p>
<p>This display ended the festivities. It was already late
June and Leonardo was anxious to return to his plans
for the water route to Italy. There was the area near
Sologne which, when flooded, would make the surrounding
countryside a marshland. This would have to
be drained by the same method as he had planned for
the Piombino and the Pontine marshes. Francis I was
interested, too, in the improvements Leonardo had suggested
for his own castle, and he would have to talk
with the castle superintendent about them. As always,
there seemed to be so many things to do, to plan, to
work on. Then Leonardo wrote in his notes: &ldquo;On the
24th of June, the day of St. John, 1518, at Amboise, in
the palace of Cloux....&rdquo; and underneath, &ldquo;I will continue&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>I will continue</i>&mdash;&rdquo; It was almost a note of defiance
against the obstacles of advancing age and sickness and
the interruptions of the practical world.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">155</div>
<p class="tb">The sound of jingling spurs and bridle chains and the
snorting of many horses announced another surprise
visit from the young king. Leonardo could hear him
below shouting something to Battista, the servant who
had come to Amboise with Leonardo. Now, as usual,
Francis was running up the stairs with all the energy of
youth shouting for &ldquo;le ma&icirc;tre&rdquo; (the master). Resignedly
and with patient humor, Leonardo stepped out to greet
the king. The gold chains around Francis&rsquo; thick neck
and over his broad chest glinted in the semi-light of the
hall, and he was holding his plumed hat at his side and
mopping his forehead with a dainty embroidered handkerchief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Master Leonardo! We are going on a tour of the
river and I want you to look at the place that I told you
about. Where I want to put that bridge. You remember?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sire, give me but a moment to gather some material
together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A chest was made ready and soon Leonardo was at
the door, calling to Francesco and Battista to help him
into the saddle of his horse, while the king&rsquo;s servants
hoisted the chest onto one of the carts already piled
high with tents and provisions.</p>
<p>When Francis was restless&mdash;which was often&mdash;a
&ldquo;tour&rdquo; could mean many hours or many days of travel.
Wagons were always kept ready with all the equipment
for a long journey and Leonardo, himself, had learned
to accept these sudden whims and kept chests of his
own ready for any such trip. Now, as always, the king
kept his horse reined back out of regard for this tall,
stooped man with the long beard and simple clothes.</p>
<p>Yet when Leonardo returned from this &ldquo;tour&rdquo; he
<span class="pb" id="Page_156">156</span>
realized that he could no longer make such trips. The
hardships of sleeping in tents, riding over the hot roads,
and the necessary work involved in surveying the possible
sites for a bridge had left him almost exhausted. He
had made one suggestion, however, and that was to
build houses that could be carried and then assembled
with a few wooden locking devices, then just as quickly
taken down and moved to the next place. They could
also be left standing where the country people could
use them while the court was away. Indeed, such
structures would seem to be the ancestors of our own
prefabricated houses.</p>
<p>The winter of 1519 was a bitter one. When the cold
fog spread over the valley shrouding the bare trees it
chilled the big, white-washed rooms of Cloux. The
wind blew down from the north sending blasts down
the chimneys and scattering ashes and sparks. Leonardo,
huddled against the huge fireplace with its roof projecting
into the room, pulled his black cloak lined in soft
leather around him and reminded himself to include
it in his will for Mathurine, the faithful domestic who
cooked for him and took care of his house.</p>
<p>The aged Leonardo, who had observed and analyzed
so much of man and nature, knew now that his own
days were numbered. When the first, pale sunlight of
March shone through the small leaded-glass windows of
his house, he applied to the king for permission to make
out his own will. French law demanded that the property
of any foreigner dying in France went to the
Crown. The permission was granted, and on April 23,
1519, Guillaume Boureau, the Royal Notary of Amboise
was summoned with witnesses.</p>
<p>To his half-brothers in Florence Leonardo left his
<span class="pb" id="Page_157">157</span>
property at Fiesole and four hundred ducats. To his
faithful friend and companion, Francesco de&rsquo; Melzi,
nobleman of Milan, Leonardo willed his notes, drawings,
and paintings. Battista was given the income that
Louis XII had granted Leonardo from the tolls of the
canal at San Cristoforo near Milan. Mathurine was
granted the &ldquo;good black cloth, trimmed with leather&rdquo;
and two ducats. Moreover, Leonardo outlined in detail
the plans for his own funeral, right down to the use of
ten pounds of candles.</p>
<p>Too weak now to stand any more, Leonardo was
confined to his big four-poster bed with the canopy.
From it he could see the tracery of the Chapel of Saint-Hubert
against the pale, foreign sky through the little
window in the corner. The vicar of the church of
Saint-Denis was called, with two priests and two Franciscan
friars, and Leonardo received the last sacraments
at his bedside.</p>
<p>An entry in his notes reads, &ldquo;While I thought I was
learning to live, I have been learning how to die.&rdquo; But
death was not easy for him. With tears rolling down his
sunken cheeks for &ldquo;his wasted life,&rdquo; he died on May 2,
1519&mdash;fighting even this final interruption to all his
work.</p>
<p>King Francis I, who was at St. Germain-en-Laye
<span class="pb" id="Page_158">158</span>
with his court, wept when the news was brought to
him. Francesco de&rsquo; Melzi was so overcome with grief
that he waited until June before writing to the half-brothers
of Leonardo of the Master&rsquo;s death. He wrote,
in part, &ldquo;He was to me the best of fathers, and it is
impossible for me to express the grief that his death has
caused me. Until the day when my body is laid under
the ground, I shall experience perpetual sorrow, and not
without reason, for he daily showed me the most devoted
and warmest affection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And in a closing paragraph Francesco added these
words: &ldquo;His loss is a grief to everyone, for it is not in
the power of nature to reproduce another such man.&rdquo;</p>

<br /><i>Mankind&rsquo;s Debt to Leonardo</i></h2>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="49" />
</div>
<p>When Leonardo died his notebooks began their separate
journeys into obscurity. They traveled to different lands
and became parts of widely disparate collections. It
has only been within the last fifty years that efforts were
made to bring them all together between the covers of
one volume&mdash;a dream that Leonardo himself entertained
but never realized. As the manuscripts and drawings
were brought to light, translated and published, the
extraordinary scope of Leonardo&rsquo;s scientific explorations
was revealed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">160</div>
<p>Mathematician, anatomist, botanist, astronomer and
geologist form only part of the long list of his accomplishments
and give the clue to the man who considered
all the natural world within his province of study.
Because of the universality of Leonardo&rsquo;s scientific
thought he has been frequently mentioned as the forerunner
of such men as Galileo Galilei, Sir Isaac Newton,
James Watt, Francis Bacon and William Harvey.
Although Leonardo cannot be credited with the actual
discoveries that these men made, his methods of investigation
pointed the way down the paths that they would
follow.</p>
<p>The key to Leonardo&rsquo;s methods lies in a quotation
from his notes on vision. He wrote of vision as <i>saper
vedere</i>&mdash;&ldquo;to know how to see&rdquo;&mdash;and he referred to the
eye as &ldquo;the window of the soul.&rdquo; Again and again, he
stressed the importance of observation and personal experience.
Although he himself was well read, he emphasized
that &ldquo;science comes by observation not by
authority.&rdquo; His supreme talent for drawing underlines
his credo and is inseparable from his science. What he
saw in the natural world about him needed investigating.
The results of these investigations were transformed
into drawings as the most certain method for passing
this knowledge along to others. The best example of
this attitude is represented by his anatomical studies.
To merely draw the living figure in front of him was
not sufficient&mdash;it was imperative to know what he was
drawing. He turned to the dissecting room and after
intensive study produced some of the finest anatomical
drawings in the world&mdash;and among the easiest for others

<p>What Walter Pater wrote of the Renaissance&mdash;&ldquo;in
many things great rather by what it designed or aspired
to than by what it actually achieved&rdquo;&mdash;could be a
summation of Leonardo&rsquo;s own lifetime of effort in
science. He labored to bring mankind from the morass
of medieval superstitions onto the firm ground of natural
facts. With an insatiable curiosity Leonardo attempted
the impossible task of encompassing all knowledge. Thus
he established his right to immortality&mdash;for it was an
attempt that shone like a beacon in a world dark with
ignorance.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
